# Homework 12


My twelfth homework post dealing with topic modeling!

***

Topic Models, in a nutshell, are a type of statistical language models used for uncovering hidden structure in a collection of texts.

In this example, I used jupyter notebooks (as was asked in the homework) to facilitate topic modelling for our dispatch of the Richmond Times.

Topic 19 (T19), including 'treasury, notes, bonds, states, certificates, secretary, confederate, cent, richmond, payment', is seeing a considerable spike in December 1864, as can be seen in the first graph with 160 mentions.
