As soon as he had performed his duty in Virginia as a citizen, he came as fast as steam could bring him to South Carolina.;;; He was satisfied it anything was to be done, it was to be done here.;;; He had no doubt it would be done, and the sooner the better.;;; Every day delayed was a day lost to the cause.;;; They should encourage and sustain their friends, and they would frighten their enemies.;;; There was no fear of Carolina remaining alone.;;; She would soon be followed by other States.;;; Virginia and half a dozen more were just as good and strong, and able to repel the enemy as if they had the whole of the slaveholding States to act with them.;;; Even if Carolina remained alone-- not that he thought it probable, but supposing so — it was his conviction that she would be able to defend herself against any power brought against her. Multitudes spoke and said the issue was one of courage and honor, or of cowardice, desertion and degradation.;;; The following are the resolutions offered in the South Carolina House of Delegates, the consideration of which was commenced on Thursday:;;; Resolved, That the Committee on the Military of the Senate and House of Representatives, be instructed to meet during the recess, and to prepare a plan for arming the State and for organizing a permanent Military Bureau; and that the said committee be instructed to report by bill to their respective Houses on the first day of the re-assembling of the General Assembly.;;; Resolved, That the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Representatives be instructed to sit during the recess and prepare a bill for raising supplies necessary to carry into effect the measure recommended by the Military Committee, and to report by bill on the first day of the re-assembling of the General Assembly.;;; Resolved, That the Governor be requested immediately to apply the one hundred thousand dollars appropriated by the last General Assembly, to the purchase of arms.;;; Resolved, That immediately after the election of the Commissioner to the State of Georgia, this General Assembly do take a recess until the third Monday, being the 19th of November, instant, at 7 o'clock.;;; Resolved, As the sense of this General Assembly, that the election of a Black Republican to the Presidency of the United States, will be the triumph and practical application of principles incompatible with the peace and safety of the Southern States.;;; Resolved, That a Commissioner be elected, by joint ballot of the Senate and House of Representatives, whose duty it shall be in the event of Mr. Lincoln's election, to proceed immediately to Milledgeville, the seat of Government of the State of Georgia, whose Legislature will then be in session, to announce to the government of that State that South Carolina, in view of the impending danger, will immediately put herself in a state of efficient military defence and will cordially co-operate with the State of Georgia in measures for the protection of Southern interest, and to express the readiness of this State to co-operate with the State of Georgia in the event of Mr. Lincoln's election in withdrawing at once from the Confederacy, and to recommend the calling of a Convention simultaneously in both States to carry this measure into effect, and to invite the co-operation of all the Southern States in withdrawing from the present Union, and forming a separate Southern Confederacy.;;; The resolution offered in the Senate provides for election of members to a Senate provides for election of members to a State Convention on the 22d instant--the Convention to meet on the 17th of December.;;; This body is to be continued by adjournments from time to time, as may be necessary, unless sooner dissolved by their own authority.;;; It shall cease and be discontinued in two years from the day on which it assembled.;;; The Charleston Mercury publishes the following suggestion for the flag of the ""Southern Confederacy :"";;; The ground entirely blue, with a golden Palmetto in the centre; a golden rattlesnake twining round the stem of the Palmetto, with its rattle sprung, head erect, and tongue protruded.;;; In the background, to the rear of the tree and snake, a golden spread eagle, and a single golden star in the upper right corner, with the words ""Room for More"" on the opposite.;;; "

On this point there is no room for question — and there need be no misgivings as to his official action.;;; The whole influence of the Executive department of the Government, while in his hands, will be thrown against the extension of slavery into the new Territories of the Union, and the re-opening of the African slave trade.;;; On these points he will make no compromise nor yield one hair's depth to coercion from any quarter or in any shape.;;; He does not accede to the alleged decision of the Supreme Court that the Constitution places slaves upon the footing of other property, and protects them as such wherever its jurisdiction extends, nor will he be, in the least degree, governed or controlled by it in his executive action.;;; He will do all in his power, personally and officially, by the direct exercise of the powers of his office and the indirect influence inseparable from it, to arrest the tendency to make slavery national and perpetual, and to place it in precisely the same position which it held in the early days of the Republic, and in the view of the founders of the Government.;;; On this point, we take it for granted, he will be firm and immovable — so as to put it beyond the hope of any class or any section to change his purpose.;;; Upon all other points his speeches justify us in saying that he will be tolerant and considerate of the rights and interests of the Southern States to the utmost extent which any man can ask. He holds each State to be completely sovereign over its own affairs, and denounces any attempt on the part of the Federal Government to interfere with slavery in the Southern States as unconstitutional and unjust.;;; While he believes that Congress has the power to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, he is opposed to its exercise unless with the free assent of a majority of the inhabitants and with full compensation to the owners of the slaves.;;; He asserts the right of the South to a Fugitive Slave Law which shall be effective in its operation.;;; He declares his opposition to negro suffrage, and to everything looking towards placing negroes upon a footing of social and political equality with the whites; but he asserts for them a perfect equality of civil and personal rights under the Constitution.;;; He acknowledges the difficulties surrounding the question of slavery; frankly confesses that he sees no way of bringing it to a safe and speedy end; deprecates the agitation which has grown out of the attempt to extend it, to nationalize it and make it perpetual; and declares his belief that by the arrest and defeat of that attempt alone can this agitation be allayed.;;; The New York Courier closes its announcement of the result with these words:;;; Abraham Lincoln is elected, but in his administration the South will find all their rights respected, and will see all the clouds of misrepresentation which have obscured his real character, and that of the party whose standard he bears, roll away from the view.-- Stretching out our hands to the South over this victory, we have no word of taunt to utter for the threats of disunion which were raised for our defeat.;;; Let those threats be buried in oblivion, for through the long vista of this success we see a reign of peace from slavery agitation, established simply by that circumscribing of slavery within its local bounds, and that firm defence of the integrity of national freedom, which this triumph of the Republican party on the 6th of November; 1860, seals now and henceforth.;;; The New York Post in concluding an article on the present prospects of its party says:;;; Our success in the election, by deciding one question, the extension of slavery to the Territories, has deprived our party of one important bond of union, one of the most powerful causes which have attracted to it the interest and favor of the people.;;; Its place can only be supplied by an earnest endeavor to distinguish the Republican administration by an enlightened zeal for the public welfare.;;;

";;; Thankful for small favors.;;; The London Times is of opinion that the people of the United States ought to be very thankful to the British Government for taking General Walker off their hands and delivering him to the executioner.;;; We suppose, also, that the arrest and detention of United States naval officers lately in Central America should form another subject of national gratitude.--But there are people who never can be made to appreciate a kind action.;;; There are hard-hearted ingrates in the United States who, instead of overflowing with love and sensibility for these and many like favors, would actually rend and devour the hand that caresses and blesses us. We apprehend that if the people of the United States were a united people, and had the faintest conception of their own strength, England would be repaid in kind for every such favor as the Times boasts of, and repaid with compound interest.;;; It is because the Governments of Europe cannot understand American forbearance, that they constantly suspect us of acting on a similar policy of selfish aggrandizement to that which dictates their own counsels.;;; They know that we are powerful, and wonder that we do not use that power.;;; So far as England is, concerned, we can reconstruct the political equilibrium on this Continent, and make the Monroe doctrine something more than a figment, without any dread of her resentment.;;; She cannot afford to go to war with a nation whose products are the first elements of industry in all parts of the world, and whose commercial intercourse makes an important branch of industry for her Government.;;; Such a war would be a violent rupture of all the arteries of commercial circulation.;;; It would be a fatal separation between England which needs America and America which does not need England.;;; Take from England the cotton of the South and what becomes of her manufacturing and commercial prosperity?;;; However, knowing we have the power of doing as we choose, and that she cannot afford to resist it, we are constantly suspected of using that power improperly, and are closely watched by the European governments upon the principle of ""set a rogue to catch a rogue."";;; Lately, however, we have developed elements of weakness, which encourage England to bestow upon us gratuitously such favors as those for which the Times calls upon us to be thankful.;;; To the machinations of her agents we are indebted, in no small measure, for the internal strife and discord which threaten our overthrow.;;; Who believes that if we were a united people, she would ever have employed her cruisers upon this coast in overhauling American vessels, or acted the part of a policeman generally in Central America?;;; The Sampson of the West is shorn of his locks by his own folly, and he seems to be destined hereafter to make sport for the Philistines.;;; "
1860-11-10_article_87	1860-11-10	article	Destitution in Kansas.	;;; Destitution in Kansas.;;; It is now more than a year since any rain save very light showers, and those few and far between, have fallen in Kansas.;;; The effect has been an almost total failure of the crops.;;; In favored localities, there has been a very short crop of corn; but wheat, oats, potatoes, buckwheat and garden vegetables have not reproduced their seed.;;; The farmers have no marketable produce with which to purchase the means of life at the grocery stores, and many of their farms, already incumbered with mortgages at exorbitant rates of interest, cannot of course be pledged for new liabilities.;;; There has been a general prostration of business, and many of the producing classes have left the ill-omened Territory.;;; The cause of such a long absence of rain is a mystery, for formerly Kansas was always visited periodically with copious showers.--The effect, however, is apparent enough, and this has probably been aggravated, as the Philadelphia Ledger justly observes, by the unnatural steps taken to force the colonizing of the Territory, and to make a State of it before it was prepared to support the necessary population, crowding it with people who had been little accustomed to the hardships and labors required in subduing a wilderness to the purposes of cultivation, and persons, too who had but little present means to support them while they were engaged in that useful work.;;; The political troubles which followed discouraged the introduction of capital in to the Territory; the settlers depended upon the crops to pay for the improvements put upon their land; but the drought has disappointed all expectations, and left the population in absolute danger of starvation.;;; In this unhappy state of things, attempts are now being made in other portions of the country to raise contributions for the relief of Kansas.;;; Many people of the South are now residing within its limits, and are suffering in common with the Northern settlers.;;; We cannot doubt that some measures of assistance will be speedily adopted by their more fortunate brethren in other parts of the country.;;;

1860-11-10_article_89	1860-11-10	article	The policy of Napoleon.	;;; The policy of Napoleon.;;; It is hard to penetrate the real purposes of the Emperor of the French in regard to Italy.;;; Many persons give him credit for the romantic generosity of desiring to emancipate that people without fee or reward.;;; Possibly, a smile lights up some wrinkle of his saturnine visage when he beholds such refreshing evidences of juvenile credulity and confidence.--Not long before the Crimean war he issued a pamphlet sustaining his own positions by the example of the great Napoleon, who, he said, only desired to make Italy French that she might become Italian.;;; The Italians of that day were greatly pleased with the prospect, but when they saw Lombardy and Venetian parcelled out into Dukedoms and Principalities, and bestowed on the Marshals and political favorites of the Emperor, their enthusiasm subsided.;;; Savoy and Nice are the first evidences that Louis Napoleon does not go a warfare upon his own charges, but they are not the last.;;;

1860-11-10_article_320	1860-11-10	article	A dark page from Russian History.	";;; A dark page from Russian History.;;; Few readers of Russian history will fail to remember the name of Count Alexey Orloff, one of the most prominent actors in the murder of Peter III, of Russia.;;; But treacherous as was that deed, it loses half its blackness when compared with another committed by him at the instigation of Catharine II., widow and successor to the murdered monarch.;;; Catharine, not being a native Russian princess, was most desirous of removing from her path all who might be supposed likely to disturb the security of her government; and in order to effect her purpose, in one instance, she and her associate Orloff exercised a degree of fiendish ingenuity almost unparalleled in history.;;; The unfortunate girl who excited the jealousy of Catharine was a Russian princess, and grand-daughter to Peter the Great.;;; Elizabeth II., his daughter, contracted a private marriage with Count Alexey Razumoffsky, and three children, two sons and a daughter, were the issue of this union.--Of the sons, it is only necessary to say that one was accidentally killed, and the other not judged of sufficient political importance to excite either jealousy or suspicion.;;; But it was otherwise with the young Princess Tarranakoff, the subject of our story.;;; The ambitious designs of the Empress Catharine with regard to Poland excited the indignation of the Polish nobles, and one of these, the Count Radzivill, conceived the design of using this young native princess as an instrument in supplanting her. For this purpose, by dint of bribing her female attendants, he secretly removed her to Poland, and thence to Italy.;;; Many attempts were made to induce Radzivill to place the young princess in the power of Catharine; but though reduced to poverty by the confiscation of his estates, the promise of their restoration, and the offer of the most costly bribes, failed in inducing him to yield.;;; No effect being produced by such proposals, the empress had recourse to threats.;;; Mysterious communications were conveyed to the Polish count, intimating that ruin and misery impended over the Princess Tarranagoff, which could be averted only by his ceasing all correspondence with her.--Whatever ambitious designs might have actuated Radzivill, he was most anxious for the safety of the unfortunate girl.;;; What could he do?;;; Shorn of his estates and dignities, and in a foreign land, how was he to protect her from a powerful empress and most unscrupulous woman!;;; Unhappily, he yielded to these covert menaces, and look a final leave of the princess, having first exacted a pledge from the Russian government that she should remain unmolested.;;; This separation effected, the most difficult part of Catharine's work was completed, and by the aid of the Count Alexey Orloff, and one of his infamous associates, the rest became easy.;;; Though the murderer of her husband, Count Alexey retained the favor of his imperial mistress; doubtless, she found him a most useful tool in accomplishing other dark deeds, though a fouler crime than the one committed on this hapless princess could hardly disgrace human nature.;;; When first resident at Rome, the granddaughter of Peter the Great was amply supplied with everything befitting her rank; but at the time Orloff came thither, she was almost in want, and occupying a poor lodging in a humble quarter of the city.;;; Judge of her surprise when an elegantly attired officer called upon her to offer his services.;;; Though he was to all appearance wealthy, and her situation one of actual indigence, he paid her the same respect as though she had been seated on the imperial throne.--When invited to sit in her presence, he respectfully declined.;;; ""Misfortune,"" said he,  ""cannot after your claims to our respect.;;; Can I, when you are before me, forget that the granddaughter of the illustrious Czar Peter the Great is entitled to all the homage I can offer!;;; Is it for me, because you are in a foreign land, to forget that to you, and not to the tyrannical foreigner who occupies it, belongs the imperial throne of Russia!;;; I have not the honor to be your country man, but believe me, princess, I am not the less devoted to your service, in which I would freely lay down my life."";;; The unfortunate princess listened with delight and thankfulness to this address.;;; It was long since such respectful language had greeted her ears, and the departure of Radzivill had almost reduced her to despair.;;; She answered this flattering speech in terms which proved how much pleasure it had given her, and desired to know to whom she was indebted for this solicitude respecting her welfare.;;; To this her visitor replied: ""That his name was of little moment, since he was only the ambassador sent by some of her most influential countrymen, whose hearts bled to think that she, the descendant of one so doubly illustrious as the Czar Peter the Great had proved himself to be, should be exposed to neglect and indigence in a foreign land.""--The princess being naturally curious to know the names of those whose interest was so deeply excited in her behalf, again pressed her visitor for information on this point, but he still refused to gratify her curiosity.;;; He, however, begged permission to present one who would explain all; and having obtained it, withdrew as from the presence of a sovereign prince, having first knelt to kiss her hand.;;; The visitor who thus imposed on the credulity of the Princess Tarranakoff was indeed employed by one of her countrymen, he being the spy and associate of Count Alexey Orloff.;;; The uniform in which he appeared was of course assumed for the occasion, as he was in reality a man of most infamous character, a Neapolitan by birth, and chosen as his tool by the count, because he had already committed crimes sufficient to prove that he would enter unscrupulously into the designs of that nobleman.;;; Ribas, for that was his name, did not at once introduce Orloff to the presence of his intended victim; he repeated his visit, and finding that she was in actual need, induced her to make use of his purse, and by the respect he paid her, completely won her confidence.;;; Now was Orloff's time.;;; When informed that the schemes of his emissary had proved successful, and the princess was duly prepared to listen to and believe whatever he might advance, the principal tragedian, as we may call him, appeared on the stage.;;; Better skilled in the ways of a count than was his emissary, the deference of the latter sank into insignificance when compared with that of his more polished employer; and so well did the latter play his part, that the princess became devotedly attached to the man whom she believed to be a model of all that was noble, good, and disinterested.;;; In a short time, Orloff had cause for exultation in the success of his plan, for the princess readily consented to be his wife.;;; A sham-marriage completed the deception, and was followed on the part of the princess by a brief period of unclouded happiness.;;; Never for a moment did she suspect the imposition that had been practised upon her, but built with the most perfect faith on the affection and sincerity of him she believed to be her husband.;;; One day he entered her presence with an air of the greatest concern, and on her inquiring the reason of his sadness, Orloff replied: ""Ah, dearest, I may well look sorrowful, since I must leave you — you whom all here call the good and the beautiful.;;; But who can tell how good or how beautiful you are in my eyes?;;; You, the granddaughter of one who made himself as illustrious by his deeds as by his high station, yet deigned to bestow on me the treasure of your love."";;; ""Why speak of this, Alexey?"" said the princess.;;; ""My birth mattered little when you sought and found me poor-nay, in want.;;; It was not on an illustrious princess you fixed your affections, but on a neglected and unfortunate woman.;;; Why should we part?;;; Can I not accompany you!;;; Am I not your wife, and as such, is it not my pleasure to sacrifice my convenience to yours?"";;; It was, of course, no part of Orloff's intention to leave his wife behind, though he was desirous that she should propose to accompany him. Hitherto, she had been carefully watched, though unknown to herself, she having attributed the continual presence of the count to the devoted affection he professed for her. She was now informed that he had received a summons to join the squadron he commanded at Leghorn, and thither she also went, and was received with many demonstrations of respect.;;; Orloff's scheme was fast approaching its completion, and the Empress Catharine, exulting in its success, prepared to shower honors on those who had labored so zealously in her behalf.;;; It was a lovely day, with the blue sky only as an Italian sky can be, when the Princess Tarranakoff, escorted by her husband, stepped into a magnificent barge.;;; Gay, and in the highest spirits, the princess laughed and chatted with attendants, little dreaming of the horrible fate impending over her. It had been arranged that she should be permitted the indulgence of a marine excursion, and she was assisted up the side of the vessel by her obsequious husband.;;; The lookers-on saw the sails spread without suspicion, and waved their farewells, deeming that they should soon witness the return of the party.;;; The hapless princess was doomed never to revisit the shores of Italy.--On board the ship were none save the creatures of Orloff; and now, having his wife completely in his power, he revealed his treachery in all its blackness and fiendish ingenuity.--The delicate wrists of the princess were manacled, and the granddaughter of the Czar was taken back to her native land, not, as she had been led to expect, with the honors due to her rank, and the prospect of a throne, but as a wretched prisoner.;;; It would be utterly impossible to depict the agony of mind she must have endured during this gloomy voyage, but probably no human being ever suffered greater, For during several years after her arrival, she was the inmate of a dungeon in the Russian capital.;;; Catharine triumphed in the success of her plan, and amply rewarded those who had too successfully carried it out. Europe might exclaim against her, but her object was gained, and the Princess Tarranakoff was in her power.;;; In her dark prison-house, the unhappy young woman spent, it is said, six years, and her deliverance came in a dreadful fashion.;;; The autumnal  equinox was at hand, and a furious gale raged in St. Petersburg.;;; The angry waves of the Neva lashed the sides of the prison in which she was confined.;;; Absorbed in sorrowful recollections, she scarcely heeded the storm, until one noticed that the floor of her dungeon was wet; then the horrible thought crossed her mind, that the river was rising.;;; Perceiving that the water gained in height, she shrieked aloud; she strove, by every means in her power, to attract the attention of her jailor.;;; But no human aid was at hand.;;; She raised herself as high as possible by means of the articles of furniture in her cell, but still the waters pursued her. The whole of the ground-floor of the prison was laid under water.;;; When the gale had passed over, and the impetuous Neva returned to its ordinary course, her jailor found only the corpse of what had been the victim of Count Alexey Orloff's treachery, and the jealous hatred of Catharine Alexiewna.;;; "

";;; The Threatening secession.;;; affairs in South Carolina--Acceptance of Senator Chesnut's resignation — the Southern Press. &amp;c., &amp;c.;;; The feeling in South Carolina for secession seems steadily to advance.;;; In the legislative debates the only difference in the views of members is about the rapidity with which the act shall be consummated.;;; The resigned Federal officers of Charleston were in Columbia Saturday, and being serenaded made speeches of the same tenor of those delivered by them a few nights since, in the former city.;;; On Saturday evening, at the town of Mount Pleasant, S. C. , some while boys, aided by negroes, were burning ""Old Abe"" in effigy, when they were fired on, and one of them shot by Jno. M. Barre, who was afterwards arrested by the citizens, and after receiving forty lashes, was placed in jail.;;; Bishop Davis, of the Diocese of South Carolina, has set forth a prayer, which is "" to be used before the two final prayers of morning and evening service, on all occasions during the ensuing session or sessions of our Legislature."" In the South Carolina Legislature, Saturday, the following took place:;;; Mr. Whaley said he held in his hand a resolution which he was certain would meet a cordial response from every member of this assembly.;;; It was as follows:;;; Resolved, That the resignation of the Hon. Jas. Chesnut as one of the U. S. Senators from South Carolina be accepted; and that what, under any other circumstances, would have been regarded with regret, is now recognized as an act of loyalty to the State of South Carolina.;;; Unanimously adopted, and sent to the Senate for concurrence.;;; Mr. Cunningham moved to proceed to the general orders with a view to take up a bill to arm the State.;;; He thought it important that the bill should get a reading in the Senate today if they wished to facilitate the business before the House.;;; At the request of Mr. Aldrich, the motion was withdrawn to permit a report to be made from the Committee on Federal Relations.;;; Mr. Aldrich then presented the report.;;; The report recommends an amendment to the Senate bill for the call of a Convention, naming the 6th day of December as the time for the election of delegates, instead of the 6th of January, and the 17th December as the time for meeting, instead of the 10th of January, as named in the Senate bill.;;; Mr. W. C. Black said he was exceedingly sorry to oppose the amendment.;;; He was perfectly willing to vote for the Convention, to go with the State, and, when she goes, to go as far as the farthest.;;; But he could not agree to the amendment proposed by the House Committee to the Senate bill, and hoped the House would not accept the amendment.;;; It was absolutely necessary that those who represented large districts, the people of which were not so thoroughly posted up as to the events transpiring around them, that they should have time to canvass those districts, and bring the people up to the point.;;; If they shortened the time they would have no opportunity to do that, and the consequences might be that those people would occupy a false position.;;; It was essentially necessary to the district he represented, that the amendment should not prevail.;;; He was exceedingly anxious, therefore, that the time should not be changed.;;; If they were precipitate, they might depend upon it, his district would not sustain the action of the House.;;; He, therefore, moved that the question be taken up by ayes and nays.;;; The bill was laid on the table to make way for the order of the day.;;; A Declaration of Independence.;;; The Washington Constitution publishes a declaration of independence, which is to be submitted at the coming South Carolina Convention.;;; The first sentence of the National Declaration is thus altered:;;; ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that although all men are created wholly unequal, mentally, morally, and physically, yet they are all equally entitled, under every civilized government, to the full protection of their lives, persons, and property, for which protection governments are solely instituted among men, deriving their just powers solely from the consent of the governed."";;; The grievances cited, are: 1st.;;; The war in the North against Southern institutions.;;; 2d.;;; The nullification of the fugitive slave law.--3d.;;; Upholding protection from slavery in the Territories. 4th.;;; The imposition of heavy taxes--""not simply without but directly against our representation, and our consent in the general Congress, by levying onerous and excessive duties upon goods imported in return for, and purchased by, our cotton, rice, and tobacco, in order to protect and encourage their own manufactures, and in order to expend vast sums at the North in improving and fortifying their own barbers, towns, and cities, at the evident and direct expense of the products and labor of the South."" 5th.;;; The election of a President whose creed is the ""irrepressible conflict."";;; The declaration concludes as follows:;;; We therefore, the representatives of the people of the State of South Carolina in convention assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State, solemnly publish and declare that the State of South Carolina is, and of right ought to be, a free and independent State; and that all political connection between it and the Northern States is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that as a free and independent State we have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which an independent State may of right do. And, for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.;;; "
1860-11-14_article_33	1860-11-14	article	Opinions of the Press.	;;; Opinions of the Press.;;; The New Orleans Delta thus speaks the day after the reception of the election news:;;; We have anticipated it from the moment the Southern people became divided into warring factions, and have had no hope for the South but in the vigorous and manly attitude of the great agricultural population of our section.;;; Nothing now remains to us but to consolidate the power and influence of this class, so as to produce a harmonious and effective movement in behalf of the freedom, safety and sovereignty of the South.;;; In that event we must look to the great Cotton States to lead, direct and control.;;; They have the deepest interest, to them the peril is greatest, and the other classes of our population must co-operate with them or take sides with our sectional enemy.;;; All parties are now extinct, except the party of the South and the party of the North.;;; The old quarrels and contests, the ancient grudges and prejudices, must be offered up on the altar of our country and our rights.;;; Men, parties and partisan traditions must alike be consigned to oblivion.;;; Our homes, our firesides, our social system, our honor, our liberty, are enough to engage our undivided affection, care, solicitude and devotion.;;; The South must consult, deliberate and determine with the grave dignity and serious purpose of a people who stand on the brink of a great peril --who are compelled to choose between a dishonorable submission and capitulation to a haughty and uncompromising enemy, for a temporary peace and the security of certain material interests, with an ever present and increasing peril to even these, or accept all the responsibility, danger and honor of a united resistance at all costs and sacrifices, to the dishonor and eventual ruin which are inevitable from our acquiescence in the government of the fanatics and sectional demagogues to whom the Northern masses have committed the powers of this Government.;;; This is the issue now presented in the South, and we shall await, with deep anxiety, the action of the leading States of our section upon it.;;; The N. O. Picayune opposes disunion.;;; It says:;;; Those who to-day refuse to make the victory lost a cause of revolution would be the first to resent and resist an open, undisguised violation of the rights reserved to the States.-- They are not less true to the South because also true to the Union.;;; They do not less see danger because they are determined to meet it in the Union.;;; And it is because of their devotion, both to the State and to the Federal Government, that they will not make an issue which cannot unite the people of the States who will all be imperiled by it, in every material and social interest.;;; A Southern Confederacy cannot be formed by States while in the Union.;;; It is forbidden by the Constitution, as is any association of States for any such purpose.;;; The secession of one State without concert with others is a species of dictation to its co-equals of the South.;;; Difficulties of every character surround the subject, and it requires deliberate preparation before a single step be taken.;;; In the meantime we shall see what necessity may exist for action.;;; We can judge whether this Government has proved a failure, and all hope of freedom is lost.;;; Such we believe will be the decision of the people of the South, and we look for the  excitements of feeling to give place to a sober, intelligent and deliberate purpose to take no hasty step, yet to be prepared for whatever the future may have in store.;;; The Alexandria (Va.)

It never becomes vitalized or forms a union with any living tissue.;;; On the contrary, it is a burden, and soon causes mischief.;;; Another party thinks that the material thus existing in the far-reaching network of lymphatic vessels is due to decay, and contains the products of organic dissolution.;;; Both opinions are well supported, and perhaps both may prove to be true.;;; That some noxious materials, whether the debris of used up tissues, or withered dead elements refusing to become new tissues, are thrown copiously near the lymphatic, is agreed; and also that the quantity of such products is so great that this active sewerage apparatus cannot carry it away.;;; It accumulates and hardens into tubercles.;;; The cause of this dreadful malady is stated by our author to be primarily the want of oxygen, whose presence in sufficient quantity would either prevent the formation of the tuberculous material, or would give power to cast it out as soon as formed.;;; A cure in the early stages of the disease is said to have sometimes been secured by the use of chlorate of potash, and other remedies which supply oxygen to the blood.;;; Prevention, however, here as everywhere, is easier than cure, and is seldom impossible, whatever be the hereditary tendency to the malady.--Muscular exercise, regular habits, fresh air, subtle food, ample rest, active occupation, well ventilated apartments, proper clothing, and exemption from corroding anxiety, are among the indispensable and most ordinary precautions.;;;

1860-11-14_article_79	1860-11-14	article	Republicanism in Europe.	";;; Republicanism in Europe.;;; The Zurich correspondent of the New York Journal of Commerce refers to the little impression made upon the public mind of Europe by Mazzini's answer to the letter of Tumaleio, the new Dictator, In which he was requested voluntarily to leave the country.;;; In that address Mazzini says:;;; ""I have made the greatest sacrifice which I ever could make, when out of love for freedom and concord I stopped the apostolate of my creed, and declared that I did acknowledge the monarchy, not from respect of ministers and monarchs, but for-the majority of the Italian people, ready to support it, if it would establish the unity of the country; and that, if once I should feel bound to raise against the old colors, I should publicly and candidly make it known to friends and foes, I cannot act otherwise.;;; If lawful men, like you, believe my words, it is your duty to convince my adversaries that the intolerance which they exercise is the only cause of anarchy which at present exists.;;; But if you do not believe a man, who for thirty years has been struggling with all his powers for the nation, who taught his accusers to stammer the word unity, and who never in his life spoke falsely, you may be as you please.;;; If men are ungrateful it is no reason why I should submit to their injustice, and moreover approve of it."";;; Nevertheless, Mazzini has left Naples, although he said he would not go, but it must be admitted that the party which he represents remains.;;; The Journal's correspondent gives to that party, under the leadership of Mazzini, all the credit of undermining the absolute monarchy and conspiring for its overthrow.;;; Without referring to more remote facts, he insists that the thorough revolutionising of the Two Sicilies and of the Papal States, the rising of the people in Sicily, in the Neapolitan provinces and in the Roman towns way, the expedition of Garibaldi and its great support with men, arms and money, as essentially and almost exclusively Republican work.;;; Garibaldi himself is a Republican at heart, as he recently affirmed anew when addressing in the city of Naples the officers of the National Guard in these words:;;; ""Mazzini is a Republican, and I am a Republican, too. I declare this loudly, as I always have pronounced it before the world.;;; But Mazzini, one of the greatest spirits and the greatest hearts of Italy, accepts to-day, what I will: The unity of the country with Victor Emanuel.;;; Mazzini does not stay here for the purpose of throwing obstacles in the way, but for furthering the national work.;;; He shall be respected like all other citizens; I will have it so. He has my word, my protection guards him."";;; We infer from the letter of the Journal's correspondent that this radical antipathy between the two factions in the Italian camp, will not be healed over by the armistice which they have concluded ""on condition,"" says the writer, ""that the monarchy should earnestly and sincerely promote the liberation and unification of the country. &amp;--It is still remembered that the Sardinian Government, though not daring to oppose Garibaldi's expedition, publicly disavowed the General's acts, and loudly protested that the armaments and expedition were undertaken without their knowledge and against their will; that they endeavored to confine Garibaldi to the island of Sicily, and to deprive him as soon as possible of his power; that they interfered by force with his expedition against Rome; that they stopped enlisting volunteers and collecting arms for him when they feared his power might become too great Count Cavour, according to recent revelations, even went so far as to call Garibaldi a crazy fool, when he started for Sicily.;;; But as soon as Garibaldi's overthrow of the Neapolitan Government was an ascertained fact, the Sardinian Government took upon itself, with charming alacrity, the full responsibility of everything that was done; with singular modesty claimed the province for itself and the constitutional party, and with exquisite coolness denounced the real authors as agitators and disturbers of peace and order.;;; King Victor Emanuel, for instance, says in his proclamation to the people of Southern Italy:;;; ""In the two Sicilies, the new order of things was instituted in my name; but some acts gave room to the apprehension that this policy, followed under my name, was not well interpreted; all Italy feared, that under protection of renowned popularity, of an antique honesty, a faction might gain strength, which would be able to sacrifice the triumph of nationality to the phantoms of their ambitious fanaticism."";;; The cause of Republicanism has suffered a heavy blow in Italy, and does not seem to have many friends in Europe.;;; The reason probably is, that Mazzini Republicanism means agrarianism, socialism, and universal anarchy.;;; "

It would appear that the demand for specie at the South has grown out of the prevalent agitations there, that have induced small capitalists to board the coin.;;; As long as this run continues the banks there must be short, and a suspension of specie payments almost a matter of necessity.;;; None of our readers need suppose that the monied institutions at the couth are doing anything to help on the agitation.;;; The suspension, if resolved on, will not be a political move, but an unavoidable measure of finance, authorized by the Legislatures, because to all appearances inevitable, whether thus sanctioned or not.

1860-11-14_article_358	1860-11-14	article	The Prince of Wales in New York.	";;; The Prince of Wales in New York.;;; The correspondent of the London Times was famously pleased with the reception of the Prince of ales in New York.;;; We extract a few paragraphs from his account, received by our last English mails:;;; There was no pomp or pageantry attempted of any kind, no grand liveries or gilded coaches.;;; There was a military procession, but that was only an item in the great feature of the day, which was the welcome of the people.;;; It was such a welcome as only a whole people and a free people could ever give, and in the details of its enthusiasm and its good order there was much, strange as it may seem, that made such a reception possible only in New York.;;; In Paris it would have been a governmental affair of soldiers and gendarmes; in London it would have been a mob with an immense police force to control it. Here it was simply the people turning out in hundreds of thousands.;;; A huge sea of decorous, but most enthusiastic spectators, who even at the spots where they were densest were yet so quiet, so impressive in their majesty of good order, that at no one place did they seem to have a single element in common with what we call a mob.;;; It seemed more a gigantic meeting of the citizens of New York, convened for some great and solemn rejoicing along the whole length of the city, than the mere chance mustering of its busy, restless, and excitable population.;;; It was such a grand display of popular enthusiasm, there was such a dignity in the calm reliance felt by every one in the preservation of order, such a perfect warmth and geniality of kindness evinced from highest to lowest towards the young visitor, as made the whole demonstration, perhaps, one of the most remarkable of its kind that has ever taken place.;;; Quiet and demure as are the English people, there are yet few Englishmen who can realize the fact of the whole inhabitants of an immense city turning out to witness a spectacle and give a cordial welcome, intrusted at the same time with the duty of keeping order among themselves.;;; Yet this was actually the case at New York; and along three miles of road, thronged with half a million or more of spectators there were not fifty policemen, and even these were only stationed at intersecting streets to stop carts and vehicles from entering the line of the route.;;; Yet description does not easily convey the idea of such a multitude — the strict, the rigid good order and good humor that prevailed.;;; This, too, was not for an hour, or only while the Prince was passing.;;; It was the unvarying demeanor of the whole concourse from ten in the day till past six at night.;;; The public of New York had been so schooled and abused by all their journals as to the necessity for a quiet, yet kindly welcome, that one would almost have thought, from the tone of the articles, that the populace of this great city were a mere horde of untutored miscreants, people to whom it was necessary to point out the most ordinary rules of civilized intercourse.;;; In fact, throughout the whole course of this tour, with few exceptions, the New York journals have never ceased to heap dirt upon the manners and customs of their own countrymen.;;; A little crowding at the country towns, the mere harmless curiosity of villagers, en route, has been transformed in the columns of certain newspapers into studied outrages, and visited, in the columns of the New York Herald particularly, with such a downpour of maudlin ""Billingsgate,"" as if any sensible American ever minded how that journal raved, must have made the poor country people regret the hour they ever saw his Royal Highness at all.;;; A long, deep, tremendous, sustained cheer greeted the Prince, whose appearance astonished every one.;;; Slight and almost boyish in his appearance in morning dress, in uniform and on horseback he looks a young nobleman, of whom, apart from his exalted position, any Englishman might be proud to see acknowledged as a representative of his nation.;;; He sits a horse as only young Englishmen can, and receives his homage of welcome with the easy grace of one to the manor born.;;; Certainly, as he cantered down to the Battery, his horse rearing and prancing with timidity at the tumult of cheers around, he looked even worthy of the great welcome that awaited him, and more than this it would be difficult to say.--In the Battery were drawn up in successive lines five brigades of the New York militia--mustering in all some 6,000 or 7,000 men.--Taken as a type of the volunteers of this country, they certainly were splendid specimens.;;; In the 3d brigade were the 7th regiment, the pride and admiration of New York.;;; They are undoubtedly, a most perfect body of soldiers, equal in all the minute technicalities of discipline to our very best line regiments.;;; I must own, however, I cannot share in the feeling here which awards all praise to the 7th, and I cannot pay the militia of New York a higher compliment than to say that, to my unprejudiced eye, there were several other regiments there almost, if not quite, as good as the famous 7th.;;; The 4th Brigade, to use Lord John Russell's simile, was ""conspicuous for the absence of the 69th Regiment. Colonel Corcoran and his officers and men refused to turn out to welcome the Prince.;;; The inspection of the militia merely consisted of riding slowly along the front of each corps.;;; Every regiment drooped colors and presented arms as the Prince approached them surveying with open admiration the handsome uniforms, the erect, steady, military aspect of every company, regiment, and brigade on the ground.;;; As a volunteer militia, they certainly formed a body of men of whom any nation might feel proud.;;; Professional Cards.;;; "

One falsehood cannot be made to sustain others, in the way the Tribune attempts."";;; This ""attempt"" of the Tribune was made in the face of the Duke of Newcastle's positive declaration, publicly made, and printed in all the newspapers of the day, that there was no ground whatever for the charge, that the conduct of the people here had been uniformly respectful to the Prince, and that he had no reason whatever to complain of his reception.;;; What object can the Tribune have in persisting in this falsehood 1.;;; Its correspondents invented a monstrous system of lies in Kansas, and it has since attempted to pass them off as history.;;; We can easily enough discern the object there; but what can it be here ! The minds of the Northern people are already sufficiently poisoned against us. Why intensify the rancor by any farther falsehoods if Lincoln is elected, and is not that enough?;;; Until of late, it was customary with public journals to correct any false statement they had been betrayed into making as soon as the mistake had been discovered. -- That good old custom is treated with scorn by such prints as the Tribune. We cannot see what was the use of sending a correspondent even as far as Baltimore.;;; A lie could have been concocted in the Tribune office just as well as in Barnum's Hotel.;;; We said a few days ago that the correspondent of the New York Times had uttered four distinct falsehoods with regard to the alleged disturbance.;;; First.;;; He said that the sheets on the Prince's bed had been handled until they had been soiled.;;; That was a lie out of the whole cloth.;;; A number of visitors, before the arrival of the Prince, passed through his apartments and looked at the beds, but not one of them touched them, or anything on them, as the Messrs, Ballard can testify.;;; For twenty four hours before his arrival, the rooms were in charge of his own officer.;;; Secondly He said that the congregation of St. Paul's Church rose when he entered.;;; That this was an unalloyed falsehood, at least one thousand persons will testify -- that is to say, the whole congregation, including the clergyman who officiated.;;; Thirdly. He said that at Washington's statue, the Prince was insulted by opprobrious allusions to the part his great-grandfather had adopted with regard to America.;;; The Mayor (Mr. Mayo) stood touching the Prince, and twenty other gentlemen stood near enough to hear anything that might have been said.;;; They all declare that not a syllable to which the Prince could take exception was uttered by any human being so far as they could hear.;;; The whole story was generated by the foul imagination of the Times' correspondent.;;; Fourthly. He said that the crowd at the Governor's House (or around it) was so disorderly, that the Prince was compelled to escape by a back entrance.;;; Governor Letcher, Mayor Mayo, Capt, Samuel Freeman, a number of gentlemen who were in the house, and at least two hundred persons outside, know that this was a falsehood.;;; We ourselves stood by the carriage and saw the Prince enter it with Mr. Mayo and the Duke of Newcastle.;;; It was drawn up at the front door.;;; Gov. Letcher stood at the door the Prince descended the steps with Mr. Mayo, and got into the carriage.;;; There was no back way by which he could have escaped into the street, if he had desired it, as anybody can see who will look at the premises.;;; If he had entered the carriage at a back door, he would have been compelled to drive around in front before he could get out. To these four distinct, positive falsehoods, we now add a fifth.;;; He stated that when the Prince arrived at his hotel, he was handled by the crowd in a very disagreeable fashion.;;; This is equally false with the other statements.;;; The crowd gave way for him wherever he approached, and not one of them touched so much as the hem of his garment.;;; The Herald tells us that the correspondents of the Tribune and London Times lied from Baltimore.;;; They simply fabricated falsehoods with regard to matters of which they could have no possible personal knowledge.;;; The correspondent of the New York Times was on the spot -- lied in the face of light and knowledge -- and is, therefore, so much the more a wilful calumniator.;;; "
1860-11-13_article_89	1860-11-13	article	Sending back Bills.	;;; Sending back Bills.;;; There are two versions of a report touching the return of Northern bills sent to Columbia, South Carolina, for collection.;;; One of these represents simply that a meeting in that town had determined to return all bills sent there from the North for collection.;;; The other version is, that the lawyers of Columbia had determined to send back all of such bills sent to them for collection.;;; The latter is no doubt the correct statement of the proceeding, if there be truth in it at all. Now, we have no idea that the people of the South intend to avoid the debts they owe as long as they are able to pay them; and the people of South Carolina are as honest as those of any of the Southern States.;;; Indeed, it is a matter of doubt whether in a game of repudiation, the South would not lose more than the North; for the North is the commission merchant for the South, and holds an immense amount of unmatted bills for staple exports from the Southern States.;;; Honesty aside, it will be to the interest of North and South, in any event, that the debts due by one to the other shall be paid.;;; The question relative to the act of the lawyers, in declining to bring suit on bills sent to them to be collected under legal process, in the present state of the country, is a very different one.;;; It presents a subject for casuistry that will readily elicit a discussion among the profession. -- Whatever may be said of this, however, we are sure that the South will pay what it owes as readily and as honorably as the people of any portion of this Union.;;; We wish the Northern States were as ready to fulfill their Constitutional obligation, as the people of the South are to pay their honest debts.;;;

The inference is irresistible that vessels are constantly sent to sea with hundreds of valuable lives on board, and yet charged with substances of the most subtle and powerful qualities, capable of causing the destruction of all on board.;;;

Only by encouraging a similar spirit, can we ever hope to shake off our commercial vassalage, and fulfill the destiny which nature seems to have marked out in the magnificent harbor of Norfolk, and the mighty streams which pour their waters into Chesapeake Bay.;;; It was by such a spirit that New York itself was built up from an inferior commercial position, and, in great measure, by the genius and energy of one man, Dewitt Clinton, who against her own absurd prejudices and stubborn opposition, succeeded at last in dragging her by the sheer force of his superior sagacity and will, into the construction of the New York and Erie Canal, and made her rich and great in spite of herself.;;; Would that Virginia could see her destiny; that she could believe in herself and in her fortunes!;;; "

1860-11-01_article_71	1860-11-01	article	European Inconsistency.	";;; European Inconsistency.;;; The people of America, in that natural sympathy which they feel with the people of all countries, who are struggling to shake off alleged oppression, should not permit their enthusiasm to blind them to certain developments of the Italian contest, which afford a striking illustration of the real respect attached to principles of international law and national rights and independence by those who are most loudly prating of them, and who are eternally denouncing this country as a nest of filibusters and land pirates.;;; The fact that adventurous and roving spirits have gone occasionally from the United States to embark in such enterprises as those of Lopez and Walker, have been made the groundwork of the most sweeping abuse and denunciation of our whole country by the European press, and an English naval commander has played the part of policeman and handed Walker over to the executioner for his filibustering forays in Central America.;;; Whilst this abusive and bloody measure is meted out to our countrymen, Garibaldi is cheered on to the echo in his filibustering descent upon Italy, supplied by Sardinia, a Power at peace with Naples, with arms and soldiers, and backed up by English volunteers, who, no doubt, have done the hardest part of his fighting.;;; And all this has been enthusiastically applauded by the same public sentiment which denounces as pirates worthy of the gallows, and hands over to the executioner, such men as William Walker, who, what ever his faults, was a man of as much courage and talent, and engaged in quite as fair and practicable an enterprise as Garibaldi. But this is not all. Here is a significant item by the Canadian's advices: The Patriot says that "":Garibaldi has thanked the seamen of the English ship Renown, who served the Garibaldian guns on the 1st of October!;;; The men were that day on leave of absence."" Observe the fact that whilst one English man-of-war is delivering one filibuster 10 death in the West, another is landing her men to fight the battles of a filibuster in the East.;;; Whether Garibaldi be a filibuster or not, makes no difference in this outrage upon national right and justice.;;; England is at peace with Naples, and the landing of trained artillerists from a British ship-of-war, to work the batteries of an enemy of Naples, is a flagrant act of treachery and injustice, which it will be idle to evade by the pitiful and unworthy pretext already prepared for the occasion, that the men were on leave of absence and acting for themselves!;;; Every one knows that they never could have obtained that leave of absence, under the circumstances of the times and place, without a design that they should take part in the contest, and that they would never have dared to take that part except with the assurance that it was agreeable to the wishes of their officers.;;; What would be said of a United States ship-of-war in Mexico, or Central or South America, if her officers should permit her men to land and work the guns in the battles of a faction in those countries endeavoring to overthrow the government Certainly, we should never hear the last of it, and would probably be threatened with European intervention to make us respect the rights of others.;;; We have no sympathy with European despotism; we should rejoice to see all Italy capable of being free; we loathe and detest oppression in all its varying forms; but even if the King of Naples be as great a tyrant as he is represented, does England pretend that oppression and despotism in one country justifies the interference of another?;;; This would be a new principle of international law, and one which, if well founded, she should hasten to apply to Turkey, Russia, Austria and Prussia, her faithful friends and allies.;;; Nay, more; if she should presume, as she dare not, to set up any such nonsensical apology as a vindication at the bar of public opinion, how would she relish its application to herself in the case of Ireland.--Suppose that impoverished and oppressed people, who have suffered at the hands of England a thousand fold more than the people of Italy have suffered from any of their rulers, should again revolt, as they have often revolted what would she think of an Irish Garibaldi? Let the gallows on which Robert Emmett and other patriots suffered answer!;;; And how would she regard the volunteering of Frenchmen, Italians and Americans under this Irish Garibaldi's banner; and what would she think of a French or American national vessel which should land its men, under pretence of a day's leave of absence, to work the guns of the rebels and batter down her strongest fortifications?;;; Yet this is precisely her own course towards the friendly power of Naples.;;; Let our countrymen remember these facts, and avail themselves of them for future reference, when we receive our periodical lectures from the London press on the forays which a few adventurers and misguided men, whom there is no power in our government or people to restrain, sometimes make from our shores.;;; There is also another fact which we wish our countrymen to bear in mind, that they may know how to appreciate the justice of the abuse which Europeans so persistently and audaciously heap upon the United States, in connexion with an alleged disposition of our Government as well as people to intervene in the affairs of neighboring and friendly States.;;; The accusation is equally groundless and malignant; but what is the example they set us?;;; The intervention by Sardinia in Naples, Sicily, and the States of the Church, is one of the most flagrant acts of national wrong and injustice recorded in the annals of history.;;; The Constitutional justly says that between the invasion of Garibaldi and of Sardinia there is a great difference; the one, himself a Roman, comes to lead the disaffected of his countrymen in their struggle against an unpopular government; but Sardinian invasion constitutes a direct intervention of one regularly constituted State in the affairs of another independent State.;;; Strange to say, Sardinian invasion took place without any declaration of war, the representative of the King of Naples still being at Turin!;;; Count Cavour gave it to be understood that the invasion by the Sardinian troops was principally directed against the influence of Garibaldi; now it has become evident that they go to aid him.-- We repeat, let Americans bear these facts in mind, and they will understand that when Europe calumniates the United States on account of its alleged contempt of the principles of international right and justice, it is not because Europe respects these principles, but because she hates our country, and is as malignant as she is corrupt, hypocritical and false.;;; "

1860-11-01_article_76	1860-11-01	article	The times are changed.	";;; The times are changed.;;; In the course of conversation a few days since, a gentleman observed to us that he had been overhauling an old file of newspapers, in one of which he found the arrival of the Duke of Kent, father of the present Queen Victoria, at Boston, announced without the flourish of a single trumpet.;;; It was while he was Governor General of Canada, (we believe that was the office he held while in America,) and must therefore have been somewhere about the cross of the last century.;;; The royal visitor quietly took up his quarters with the British Consul, and attracted no sort of attention and remark, beyond a short newspaper paragraph or two.;;; Our friend entered into a train of reflections suggested by the contest between this species of reception and the series of ovations which sprung up as if by magic in the footsteps of his descendant, when he lately visited our shores.;;; It was very great, it must be owned, and yet it was not at all strange.;;; The Duke of Kent was but a King's son — the fourth in point of birth, and therefore a very distant expectant of the crown.;;; Between him and the throne, lay three others, big, burly, life-like, in the flower of life, the oldest not being forty years of age. Who could expect that young man to outlive all those sons of Anak, the gigantic George, the gigantic Frederick, and the gigantic William? In point of fact, though the youngest, he was the first of the four to die. But who could have guessed, that a child of his, even, would ever succeed to the throne of his ancestors?;;; All these young giants might marry according to law--one of them actually was married, and the Princess Charlotte was already born.--The chance of Kent, and his posterity, therefore, was beautifully small — like the small end of nothing whittled down, to use a phrase said to have originated with old Ben Hardin--so small that it was scarcely visible, and might be said, almost, not to have existed at all. Now, Lord Brougham tells us, that while the Prince Regent was carrying on his prosecution of his wife — endeavoring to get her decapitated by his Parliament — the people were stirred against him to such a degree of intensity, that had a tolerably popular Prince of the blood offered himself as an aspirant for the crown, he would infallibly have overset the older brother.;;; For many years before that trial — ever since he had been Regent indeed — he had passed along the same street every day, in his carriage, and had scarcely been noticed.;;; Yet no sooner had he been crowned, than the poor Queen and all her wrongs were forgotten, and the same people who had scarcely raised their eyes to look at the chariot and livery of the Regent, could scarcely be kept off the chariot and livery of the King.;;; Yet it was the same chariot, the same equipage, and the same man. So great is the difference between him who is merely a King's son, and him who is King in his own person.;;; Now, it is probable that the Prince of Wales in a very few years will pass through London without attracting more notice than his granduncle did when he was Regent, and that he will stir up the loyalty of John Bull afresh when be becomes King.;;; John has seen so many Kings and Queens that he cares not to look upon royalty in prospect. But Brother Jonathan, while he cares nothing for a man who is only a King's son, with no prospect of being King himself, satiates his curiosity by gazing upon the undoubted heir of royalty.;;; He never saw before a man who was certain to be King, if he only fulfilled the condition of outliving his mother.;;; This is the nearest approach he can make to seeing a King, and he makes the most of his opportunity.;;; The relative situation of the two countries (England and America,) was at the time (1799,) very different from their present relations.;;; We had then hardly recovered from the heartburning which the war of independence had produced.;;; But a few years before, the English had come from Canada, built forts within our borders, and instigated the Indians to make war upon us. So we thought, at least, and there seems to be little cause for distrusting our suspicions.;;; That war-loving Minister, the younger Pitt, was at the head of affairs, and it seems to have been a principle with him never to ask for anything in a civil manner, but to knock the man down first, and take what he wanted.;;; ""Britannia ruled the waves"" at that time, with a vengeance.;;; ""Nelson was then Britannia's God of War,"" and he ruled the waves with a will.;;; He, and the Minister, and all their subordinates and understrappers, naval, military and judicial, firmly believed that no other nation upon the face of the earth had any rights of their own, and that all the privileges they enjoyed were so many grants from Great Britain, to be resumed at her own good pleasure.;;; Innumerable causes of quarrel necessarily sprung up with our neighbors across the Canadian line, as well as with John Bullon the ocean.;;; We looked upon them as they have always looked upon the French since the wars of Edward III., five centuries ago; that is to say, we regarded them as our natural enemies; and forty-five years of peace have not entirely eradicated that impression.;;; It is hardly wonderful, then, that the arrival of the Duke of Kent created no extraordinary sensation in Boston.;;; A few old Tory families, of pre-revolutionary times, were still in existence.--Doubtless these paid their duty to him, whom they considered the son of their lawful sovereign.;;; But the body of the people would have considered it, no doubt, unpatriotic, anti-republican, and derogatory to their character, for independent opinion and manly bearing.;;; "

'Who, for example, makes your tea?';;; ""'The housemaid, Hepzibah, generally; but sometimes old Oh'--Mary checked herself.;;; ""'I beg your pardon--who?';;; ""'I was about to name an old woman we have taken into the house to help the housemaid, but, for some reason I have not inquired, she does not wish it to be known.';;; ""'Old Charlotte!' ejaculated Mawry.;;; ""'Such is her name,' replied Mary, astonished at his astonishment.;;; ""Mawry, who had sat down again, got up with a face white as ashes.;;; ""'I — I have a word to say to Mr. Ainsley,' he said, and took a hasty leave.;;; ""Charles was reading medicine in the Angel-room.;;; ""'Good Heavens, sir!' exclaimed the little doctor, bursting in, 'do you know what you have got in your house?';;; ""Horrid visions of his Mary in typhus fever — in small-pox — a lunatic — flashed like lightning across Charles's mind.;;; ""'What--what ?' he gasped out.;;; ""'Moll Murder!';;; ""'Moll what?';;; ""'The old bag to whom the boys in the town have given that title, for her strange association with every death that has occurred in this unhappy house since it became your uncle's. The very worst suspicions cleave to her. For mercy's sake, Mr. Ainsley, get rid of this old wretch before you are an hour older!';;; ""Charles stood aghast. 'Is it — possible that'--;;; ""'I know not what is possible; but do it, sir — do it,' said the eager apothecary; and Charles, infected with his earnestness, promised compliance.;;; ""That night Charlotte was dismissed, this time taking her pattens with her, as though her work were done.;;; ""'Touched and took!' was Charlotte's benediction, looking back and shaking her finger as she passed the door.;;; ""Let me pass quickly over these sad details, The young wife was indeed doomed.;;; Drooping gradually, like the preceding victims, she slowly but certainly followed them to the same bourne.;;; ""Ainsley would have left the house, but nothing could induce Mary to consent.;;; His uncle would be vexed; would think them careless, ungrateful — besides, they had no other home.;;; Most of all she earnestly desired, if die she must, to breathe her last in the Angel-chamber, with those glorious eyes and protecting arms above her.;;; ""She had her wish; and, in a few short weeks, the fourth victim to the mystery of that house slept in the village churchyard.;;; ""The popular feeling against old Charlotte had by this time attained such open expression, that it became absolutely necessary to investigate its grounds.;;; She was accordingly given into custody.;;; Some examinations took place; but the doctor being compelled to certify to a case of natural death, and no direct inculpatory evidence being adduced, the prisoner, on the very day of poor Mary's funeral, was restored to liberty, and immediately disappeared.;;; ""It was now imagined that the house would be finally closed.;;; The next-door neighbor on one side had already quitted; he on the other had given notice.;;; Mr. Archbold himself felt his mind infected by the prevailing superstition; and, moreover, seeing the cause of misunderstanding removed, was ready enough to give indulgence to his returning kindness towards his nephew, to whom he accordingly wrote, desiring him to quit without delay the scene of his bereavement, and resume the place he had formerly held in his uncle's home and affection.;;; ""Charles refused.;;; ""He considered that his uncle, in placing them in a house under this notorious ban, had been actuated by less disinterested motives than he had imagined, and had been even in some degree instrumental in the fatal misfortune that had befallen him. Besides, he had a duty to perform, to which it was his fixed determination to devote every energy he possessed — nay, if needful, life itself.;;; He would find out the mystery of the haunted house.;;; And no knight, in quest of the holy grail, ever started on the doubtful way with more resolved purpose than Charles, when, returning from his Mary's funeral, he re-entered the desolate mansion.;;; ""He was alone, absolutely alone; for poor Hephzibah, though attached to her master, and pitying him with all her honest heart, had evinced such unmistakable symptoms of aversion to sleeping another night in the house, that Charles, unshaken in purpose, judged it best to dismiss her at once to her friends.;;; So the door closed behind the sobbing Hephzibah, and Charles was alone, absolutely alone.;;; ""For hours he sat musing by the melancholy fire, undisturbed by a single sound.;;; Evening at length approached, and still he sat, as though Memory had chained him hand and foot to the place where he had passed so many happy hours.;;; Gradually, he got into a train of recollection that conducted him through the entire history of his lost love, from the first chance meeting when he had stopped, a lost, benighted hunter, to inquire the road, and Mary's azure eyes glittered in the starlight, as if they belonged to it, while she stepped forward to his horse's side, and raised them in directing him. He had arrived at the evening when they had come, with their modest baggage and rustic henchwoman, to the magnificent house, had examined its alarming glories, had dined merrily, and were reclining in their deep velvet chairs, their laughing faces reflected grotesquely in the polished stove, up to the moment when old Charlotte, like an evil genius, appeared at the door.;;; ""At that moment a sound struck Charles's ear — it was like a distant footstep somewhere within the house.;;; The door of the room in which he sat was wide open, and presently he was aware of a slow soft step ascending the stair.;;; ""To say that Charles's heart did not accelerate its usual pace by a pulse or two, would be to deny a feeling that might have so far assailed the most collected.;;; An idea that the bold resolution he had formed was about to be met half-way, that the mysterious Horror of the House was actually approaching him in an incarnate shape, struck the listener with an appalling sense of being suddenly called upon to deal with what one cannot comprehend.--Charles involuntarily griped the velvet arms of his chair, and half rising, slowly turned his face to the door, where the step had halted.;;; ""There stood old Charlotte!;;; ""His fear melted into rage.;;; ""'Wretched old hag!--accursed murderess!' he exclaimed, forgetting for the moment his own doubts of her guilt--'dare you'--;;; ""'Charles Ainsley,' said the old woman, walking up to him, 'it is you who should not dare. I warned you — I warned your mother — I warned Mrs. Callender--I warned every one of you, young and old, of the danger hidden in this fearful house.;;; Yet I loved and served them all when they would let me, and to do so ran the same risk with them.;;; For reward, you have put the murderer's mark on me. I am the devil's mate, Moll Murder, the old poisoning witch.;;; My life is nothing; they might as well have hanged me. I hoped they would, for the Lord keeps justice for the innocent, and He knows that I never willingly harmed a living creature.;;; They were all touched and took, poor dears!;;; but not by me. I know you are come back to find out who killed your darling, and old Charlotte's come to help you.';;; ""'You!';;; ""'Like enough in some things,' said the old woman steadily.

Charles instinctively staggered forward, as in pursuit, reached the window, and throwing it up, gazed forth into the calm, cold night.;;; ""'Whence, whence, O Horror!""he gasped.;;; ""The next moment, with a countenance deadly white, he reclosed the window, and returned to his bed.;;; ""In that instant, the Horror, the Ghost, had revested itself to him, as be had desired.;;; ""But Charles would have further proof, and witness too.;;; ""The following morning, after pretending to eat some portion of the breakfast he found comfortably prepared for him in the library, Charles summoned old Charlotte to a conference.;;; ""She came, so changed, that her master could scarcely recognize, in the hale, respectable-looking matron before him, the wretched old outcast of the previous day. But I have said that Charlotte had, in common with other humble creatures I have met with, a way of brightening and expanding under certain influences, which revealed qualities hitherto wrapped in shade.;;; The troubles she had undergone, above all, the foul stigma under which she labored, had had a purifying and vivifying effect, so apparent in her manner and language, that Charles secretly congratulated himself on his ally.;;; 'He began by tracing as minutely as possible the history of the later illnesses and deaths, beginning with that of his mother, which event occurred during his absence abroad.;;; In this he received most material assistance from Mr. Mawry, for whom he sent during the morning, and who, after overcoming his astonishment at finding old Charlotte a member of the council, entered with all zeal into the inquiry.;;; ""The result proved that the same extraordinary symptoms had been evolved in every case — namely, severe nervous, semi-cataleptic attacks, prostration of strength, mental depression, decay of the vital powers, and death — Mawry declaring himself utterly unable to account either for the origin of the disease, or for the rapidity and certainty with which, once conceived, it hurried the victims to their end.;;; ""On receiving the information he had gathered, Ainsley was struck with one singular feature in the case — the predilection evinced by every patient in turn for the Angel-chamber.;;; It seemed a fatal fancy; for, certainly, whatever soothing influence it might exercise on the minds of the invalids, was not reflected in their bodies.;;; On the contrary, every one became rapidly worse, and the mysterious Terror — though its recurrence grew more and more frequent — seemed gradually to lose its intensity, in proportion as physical health declined, till it left the last days of the sufferer wholly undisturbed.;;; ""'Now,' said Charles, as with a deep sigh he raised his pale face from his hands, after a minute's meditation, 'come with me, and I will show you the Horror in the House.';;; ""He walked, followed by the others, straight to the Angel-room.;;; There it shone, with its regal couch, its superb mirrors, its glowing cabinets, its purple curtains.;;; Charles threw up the window, admitting the soft fresh breeze.;;; "" 'Does this,' he asked, 'look like a pestilence palace — a house of pain and death?';;; ""He struck upon one of the gilded panels as he spoke; it returned a hollow sound, like an echo of the last word, 'death !';;; ""The next moment, Charles caught up a poker from the fireplace, and dashed in the panel.;;; "" 'Stoop down,' he said to Mawry.;;; ""The latter did so, but started back in horror, as a sickening, loathsome odor pervaded the apartment, as from a newly-opened grave.;;; ""There lay indeed the secret of the Horror.--Out of that panel crept the unseen destroyer that had sucked away the breath, the life of no less than five victims.;;; ""From the Angel-chamber, which had been originally intended as a luxurious bath-room, a pipe had been prepared, the other extremity of which had vent in the sloping bank of the adjacent cemetery, long since become one mass of corrupting human clay.;;; Thus, this fatal conduit, itself decayed, winding among broken vaults and mouldering mausoleums, gathered up the noxious exhalations, and poured them into the golden room.;;; By what atmospheric changes, or movements in the earth, the amount of miasma thus transmitted was governed and modified, cannot of course be known; but that the poison varied in quantity and strength, was sufficiently proved by the fact, that attention was never attracted to the vitiated atmosphere of the spacious and seemingly well-ventilated room.;;; ""The panel which concealed the mouth of the pipe was low down — exactly on a level with the head of one sleeping in the Angel-bed, and probably distant from it but three or four feet. An almost imperceptible crevice in the thin panel must have projected that baneful breath into the sleeper's face as certainly, and, as it proved, as fatally, as the 'juice of cursed Hebron' dropped from the phial of the Danish regicide.;;; No marvel that the end was rapid ! To turn the face to that wall, was indeed to bid adieu to life, its hopes, its troubles, and its cares.;;; ""Those most remarkable symptoms I have had to relate, can only be referrable to nervous temperament, or to the mysterious trouble acting almost in the nature of disease, until disease was positively engendered.;;; ""When, on the previous night, Charles threw up the window, some slight odor eliminated from the burial-ground, connecting itself with the loathsome sense from which he had just escaped, at once revealed to him the latter origin.;;; ""I gave you to understand, children, that this story was true; I now repeat that it is based on actual and melancholy fact.;;; ""Many a child's banquet have I shared in that fatal chamber with my pretty May."";;; Professional Cards.;;; "

Every incident of the campaign of this furious and fanatical party, led on by the arch-traitor Seward and his confederates, was indicative of hatred and vindictiveness towards the South.;;; All sense of obligation to the Constitution and the laws,--all the feelings of reciprocal affection between the people of the North and the South, as descendents alike of ancestors who perilled their blood and treasure for the rights and liberties we enjoy — all regard for the ties of sympathy and interest, the policy of the common defence and general welfare on which the Union itself was founded under an agreement of the sovereign States--were utterly ignored and the wild fury of party and determination to seize power and the perquisites of office by banding together every element of hostility to the South, ruled the hour, and reason and right gave way to the mere will of numerical power.;;; When we turned to the South we beheld a scene of discord without precedent in its history.;;; The several parties arrayed there against one another were bitter in their denunciations of each other, and active in the raising and pressing of issues that were untimely and injurious in their effects.;;; Altercation of the most unprofitable character was freely indulged; and never before was there in the South so much public speaking in a Presidential canvass, and never to so little profit and benefit.;;; We may say never so much to the general injury and disadvantage of the Southern people.;;; Nothing could be more grateful to the common enemy, whose drilled cohorts were steadily marching to victory.;;; The arch-fiend of the infernal regions could not gloat with more pleasurable emotions over a fend in Paradise, than did the partisans of Lincoln over the idle internal war among Southern politicians and their passionate followers.;;; These scenes and this unprofitable struggle have come to an end. Lans deo! We have in exchange for the dread of an event, the event itself.;;; Lincoln Is Elected! It is much more grateful to a manly sensibility to be striving with fortitude to repair the injuries of a calamity than to be fearfully contemplating one that we know not how to avert.;;; We can now take time to consider.;;; Inexperienced and hot-headed young gentlemen who have intemperately and recklessly pressed impracticable issues may now have leisure to reflect and draw lessons of wisdom, we hope from the errors which they have committed.;;; Elder gentlemen, somewhat waspish and exasperated, whose lives have brought them more grey hairs than discretion, may, for awhile, occupy themselves in the same profitable self-examination, though we fear not with the same chances of benefit that are enjoyed by their younger contemporaries.;;; The election of Abraham Lincoln has indeed put this country in peril.;;; With him comes that calamity which Washington dreaded as a wedge that would assuredly split the Union in twain, viz: a sectional party in one division of the Union founded on issues hostile to the people of the other, seizing the reins of government and dictating rulers to the nation.;;; He saw in this an outrage, an alienation of the affection and sympathies of the States, which, sooner or later, would dissolve the Union.;;; He was right.;;; It can only be a question of time.;;; Two people who are thus led to hate one another, and struggle against each other, cannot long continue to live together under the same Government.;;; Mr. Fillmore, who has filled the seat first occupied by Washington, pronounced the triumph of the sectional party at the North a sufficient cause for the secession of the Southern States from the Union, and when he carried the argument home to his fellow-citizens of New York by asking them whether they would submit if the South, having the power, were to say that none but slaveholders should hold the office of President, and should proceed to fill the Presidential chair alone with such men — the unanimous response was ""no!"" And rightly; for that would be an exercise of tyranny that make submission a state of vassalage.;;; Yet while we consider the continuation of the Black Republican crusade against the South as incompatible with the existence of the Union, we trust that the South will forbear at this time to take any extreme measure.;;; Not that we wait for an ""overt act."" We do not ""wait for a sign."";;; The outrage perpetrated is great, and cannot be wiped out by the failure of Lincoln to commit an ""overt act."";;; But there are reasons why we should wait and try to preserve this powerful union of States, in spite of fanaticism and the unchivalrous and unscrupulous, and the low and depraved instincts which govern the great body of the leaders of the Black Republican party at the North.;;; It is at least a reasonable conjecture that Lincoln owes his elevation to the Presidency to the divisions and discords of those who are opposed to him and his party.;;; Those whose delinquency we may thus rationally conclude has produced this deplorable result, ought not to break up the Union for their own fault.--Besides, we of the South see at the North an immense body of faithful citizens, who constitute large minorities in every Black Republican State, who have struggled with unfaltering constancy against the baleful power of the party which hangs like a black cloud over the fate of the nation.;;; They have been true to the Constitution and to their fellow-citizens of the South.;;; Ought we not, for their sakes — who have been true where if costs something to be true — to wait and struggle with them a while longer, trusting that they may yet rule the North through accessions to their ranks from the sober second thought of masses of misled honest mer., who have followed the delusive lights of the fanatics and the unprincipled demagogues who direct the fell agitation in the free States?--May we not argue that this would be wise and considerate, and that the South may with justice to herself pursue this course?;;; May we not hope that in four years, by calmly awaiting events, a great revolution may take place in public sentiment at the North, and we shall again have national parties predominating there which shall be in correspondence and sympathy with the same parties at the South, and that the harmony and fraternal regard of the two divisions of the Union will be happily restored?;;; Let us at least hope that it will, and that this Union is destined, in spite of the gross aberration of the public mind at the North, to endure through a cycle of time bearing at least some respectable comparison to the duration of the more powerful nations of the world.;;; "

But her excellent luck seems of late to have deserted her. Her late tour of three weeks in Germany was attended by many small disasters.;;; She started on a pouring wet day and reached Cobourg with a bad cold, which prevented her from visiting many places of interest; then Prince Albert's grandmother died as soon as they arrived at their destination; then the Prince Consort had a narrow escape of his life.;;; This was followed by the insulting detention of her Majesty's steam yacht Fairy, and almost a fight between the Jack tars and the German officials.;;; The weather was bad during almost her entire visit.;;; She arrived, however, safe home at last.;;; The Queen, Prince Albert, Princess Alice, Prince Albert Edward and Prince Albert were all away from England at one time.;;; 
1860-11-09_article_90	1860-11-09	article	Wine in America.	";;; Wine in America.;;; It is evident that the culture of the grape in this country, and the manufacture and traffic in American wines, are destined to become one of our prominent interests.;;; It originated in Cincinnati through the enterprise and public spirit of one of its citizens, who not only imported his original grape vines from France, but also obtained from that country vine cultivators and dressers, and a number of men who were perfectly conversant with the manufacture of champagne.;;; A gentleman who has lately visited Cincinnati gives an interesting account in the Philadelphia American of the result of his observations of the wine manufacture.;;; He found in the vaults of the principal wine manufacturer in that city 250,000 bottles of American champagne, as the ""Sparkling Catawba"" is designated, that were old, ripe and ready for export; also, about 100,000 gallons in casks, one of which contained nearly 5,000--all fit, either for ""still"" or sparking Catawba.;;; The crop of grapes in the neighborhood of Cincinnati last year produced one million gallons of wine.;;; The crop of 1858 yielded one million and a half.;;; Every bushel of grapes weighing sixty pounds makes four gallons of wine.;;; The sparking wine is kept about eighteen months prior to sale, and the still wine two and a half years. The greatest drawback in the trade, is the bursting of bottles, from the inexperience of the bottlers and cellar men. It is believed that, in a few years, three millions and a half of gallons of wine will be manufactured in this country.;;; The writer says that in every degree of latitude within the United States grapes may be grown to perfection, and, as different sorts are successively introduced, so will varieties of wine prevail.;;; If we have the proper soils — the climate is said to be all that can be desired — clarets, ports and sherries will become home products.;;; Should an era of cheap wines be inaugurated in this country, the vice of intoxication will probably diminish.;;; On this subject, an experienced gentleman in the wine culture of Cincinnati stated that the quantity of harder spirits consumed annually in Russia was 24,000,000 of gallons — that the amount produced from wine lees in France was about the same — and that the exportable quantity produced in America was similar.;;; This information was elicited by the interrogatory, as to whether much whiskey was exported from this country to France, to be made into a spurious brandy.;;; He said that the statistics he had given would show that it would not pay — the ardent distilled from lees of wine being cheaper.--True, one or two experiments had been made with success, but that was during a scarcity of the grape crop in France — that even then they did not compensate, and that now they would prove a certain loss.;;; Therefore, no whiskey whatever is now exported to France to be converted into brandy.;;; From 1,500 to 2,000 gallons of whiskey are brought into Cincinnati daily, some of which would ""kill at twenty yards."";;; "
1860-11-09_article_91	1860-11-09	article	Utah.	";;; Utah.;;; Whilst the country has been agitated from its circumference to its centre upon the right of a State, under a certain contingency, which had not occurred, to secede from the Union, the singular spectacle of a Territory complacently, contemptuously and with impunity, setting at defiance not only the power of the Federal Government, but the public sentiment of the whole civilized world, has scarcely provoked a word of comment.;;; At an enormous expense, a large portion of the United States Army, under the command of an experienced officer, was sent to subdue rebellion and establish the authority of the laws in Utah.;;; Yet, to this day, it is impossible to execute the laws in Utah, and the most horrid crimes remain unpunished.;;; No one has been tried, and, of course, no one punished for treason against the General Government; and though there has been a nominal recognition of the supremacy of the United States, it has been only nominal, as all the officers, both civil and military, of the United States will testify.;;; The singular condition of things in Utah exhibits in a striking light the reluctance of our government and people to adopt the ""ultima ratio"" with a rebellious province, even though it be such a province as Utah.;;; If it be possible to imagine a case in which the most thoroughgoing Quaker in the world might approve the use of the sword even to extermination, it was the case of Utah.;;; It was not only in open and defiant rebellion, but it was composed mainly of foreigners, who never had cherished or professed any feelings but those of ill will and hatred towards this country; and by its brutalizing system of polygamy, and by the most shocking moral abominations, including a legalized system of murder, had provoked the vengeance of God and man. Yet a long period elapsed before any measures were adopted to coerce this refractory and reprobate territory, and when an army at last was sent, Peace Commissioners were sent with it who tied up its hands and prevented it from using the weapons with which it was provided.;;; The country has stood by and seen Brigham Young come successfully out of his conflict with the federal government, and made no complaints of the manner in which its authority has been set at naught, so opposed is the public sentiment of the United States to compulsory measures and to shedding blood in vindication of its authority.;;; "

Dumas signalized his accession to office by giving a magnificent dinner to sixty guests at the public expense.;;; This performance, eminently French, was the first and last official act of the great Dumas. The Italians, do not, like the French, appreciate this delicate mode of promoting the public interests, and accordingly raised such a clamor about the ears of Dumas, that he was glad to retire once more to that post of honor, a private station.;;; During the brief reign of the Reds, ten years ago, in Paris, they made hay while the sun shone, and kept up a degree of state quite unknown in the days of the Citizen King.;;; Ledru Rollin had more horses and carriages, all at the public cost, than were maintained by Louis Phillipe and all the royal family.;;;

Vernon, on Saturday evening last, at a quarter before 4 o'clock, and at 6 o'clock landed on Mr. Henry Smith's farm, near Hampton, thus making the distance of 90 miles in two hours and a quarter.;;; The Norfolk Day Book says:;;; This is the largest balloon trip on record in this State, and places the Professor a long way ahead of all his local contemporaries.;;; On the passage from Richmond he made two ineffectual attempts to land, but each time fell in James river.;;; The last time his basket upset and he lost all his ballast.;;; The balloon being now freed of considerable weight, shot up about three miles, where the atmosphere was so cold as to almost give the Professor a chill.;;; At this altitude the gas was so expanded that it rushed through the neck of the balloon and escaped, thus causing the serial ship to fall as rapidly as he had gone up. On the approach to the earth a strong current of wind, rushing at the rate of a mile a minute, caught him, and in three or four minutes more would have carried him over to the very centre of the Chesapeake Bay; fortunately, however, he was enabled to grapple to a pine tree on the farm above mentioned, where he left his balloon floating in the air until next morning, when, with the kind assistance of Mr. Smith, he pulled it down.;;; The Professor thinks of getting up an excursion from this place back to Richmond, and is of the opinion that if he can strike the proper current he can reach Richmond in two hours. He is a daring and skillful serial voyager, and deserves success.;;; The returns;;;

Brown, in a special message to the Georgia Legislature, thinks that few States will meet in a Southern Convention, and does not recommend the appointment of delegates from Georgia to one.;;; He thinks the Constitutional rights of the people of Georgia have been violated by several of the non-slaveholding States to an extent justifying, in the judgment of civilized nations, the adoption of any measures for their restoration and future protection.;;; He refers to the patriotic spirit or the origin of our Government, and then recounts the unconstitutional and unfriendly legislation of many of the Northern States.;;; He is particularly severe on Massachusetts, and thinks, as the laws of that State sanction the robbery of Southern States, her citizens should be compelled to compensate us. He advises reprisals, and says we should meet illegal and unfriendly legislation with just retaliation.;;; He recommends the passage of laws authorizing the seizure of such amounts of money and property belonging to the citizens of the offending and faithless States as shall constitute an indemnification to the citizens of Georgia for their losses.;;; Also, legislation to drive the manufactured articles of such offending States from Georgia.;;; As Georgia has the right, as soon as Northern goods are introduced within her limits, to tax them as she deems proper, she should pass a law, taking effect after the 1st of January, taxing goods 25 per cent., if brought from Massachusetts, Vermont, Michigan, Maine, Rhode Island, New York, Wisconsin and other unfriendly States, the tax to be remitted when unfriendly legislation is repealed.;;; Should such legislation be ineffectual, she should repeal all parts of the penal and civil code protecting the lives and properties and liberties of these States where such unfriendly laws shall exist.;;; In his opinion, the time for bold and decided action had come — and he would be unworthy of the confidence of the people of Georgia who refuses to vindicate her honor at every cost and maintain her Constitutional rights at any hazard.;;; The legislation recommended will, he thinks, lend rather to strengthen than weaken the Union, as it will destroy the sectional issue and narrow the issue down to a contest between individual States.;;; It the Legislature fails to enact laws, the people should rise in their right, and at the ballot-box demand, their enactment.;;; Every State has a right to act for herself, and as long as all the States abide in good faith by their Constitutional obligations, no one State could withdraw from the Confederacy without being guilty of bad faith to the others; but any violation of the compact relieves all the parties from their obligations.;;; The right of secession, for cause, is only denied by those who deny the sovereignty of States.;;; The message occupies twenty-two closely printed octavo pages, and contains a full review of existing offensive Northern legislation.;;; It concludes thus:;;; ""For the purpose of putting the State in a defensive condition as fast as possible, and preparing for any emergency which must be met, sooner or later, I recommend that the sum of $1,000,000 be immediately appropriated as a military fund for the ensuing year, and that prompt provision be made for raising such portion of the money as may not be in the public treasury as fast as the public needs require its expenditure. 'Millions for defence — not one cent for tribute,' should be the future motto of the Southern States.;;; To every demand for further concession or compromise of our rights we should reply, 'The argument is exhausted, and we low stand on our arms."";;;    Charleston, Nov. 8.;;; --In addition to the other Federal officers here who have resigned, Mr. Jacobs, Deputy Collector of the port, had notified the President of his resignation.;;; All the officers of the United States government in this city intend resigning on the inauguration of Lincoln.;;;    Washington, Nov. 8.;;; --The Administration continues to be privately advised of the condition of affairs at the South.;;; There has been no formal consideration of the subject in the Cabinet, and consequently no course of action is determined on. It is known that there is a difference of opinion among the members of the Cabinet on the distinctive legal question of succession; but this does not involve the resignation of any of them.;;; It is not contemplated to send additional troops to Southern military posts.;;;    Savannah, Ga., Nov. 8.;;; --A mass meeting, the largest ever assembled in this city, was held here to-night.;;; Eloquent speeches were made, and resolutions unanimously adopted declaring that the election of Lincoln ought not to be submitted; to asking the Legislature to communicate that opinion to the representatives of Georgia in Congress, and co-operate with the Governor in calling a State Convention to determine on the mode and manner of redress; recommending the Legislature to pass such laws as will alleviate the very unusual commercial embarrassments consequent on the present political emergency, and to take immediate steps to organize an armed force in the State.;;; A colonial flag was raised this afternoon on Green's monument, in the presence of an immense multitude.;;; Several speeches were made.;;; Great excitement prevails here, and a large number of Minute Men have been enrolled.;;; "

The dispatch says:;;; The pole was made of Carolina pine, one hundred feet high, and surmounted by the cap of liberty.;;; Cables were stretched across the streets to prevent the passage of vehicles.;;; There was a dense crowd, extending over two squares on Meeting street.;;; The neighboring house-tops were crowded with people.;;; Thousands of ladies of the highest respectability thronged the balconies and windows, waving their handkerchiefs.--Impromptu stands were erected, and the principal merchants took seats.;;; The flag was then hoisted, amid the tremendous cheering of the populace and the greatest excitement ever known here.;;; When the cheering succeeding the hoisting of the flag subsided, Rev. C. P. Gadsden made the following prayer:;;; O, God!;;; our refuge and strength, the shield of our help and the sword of our excellency, we come before Thee to express our dependence upon Thy succor, and our need of Thy guidance and defence.;;; The liberties with which Thy protection blessed our fathers being imperiled, we ask Thy favor and aid.

Barker, Robertson, Canneau, Hammond and Northrop.;;; The Washington Artillery paraded, and fired one hundred guns as the flag went up. Bells were rung and the band played the Marseilles Hymn.;;; This fired up the French element of our population.;;; After the Marseilles, the band played the ""Miserere,"" from "" Trovatore,"" for the Union.;;; The flag is white, with a Palmetto tree in the centre, and bears the words ""Animes assibusque parati. "" At the same time the Charleston Hotel, the Mills House, and other large hotels, flung out the Palmetto flag.;;; All this occurred in the full blaze of the noonday sun, and the people vowed that the stars and stripes should never wave again in Charleston.;;; Then speaking began.;;; The addresses were short but stirring, and all were from persons engaged in business, and who seldom meddle in public affairs.;;; This was emphatically a movement of the people and not of politicians.;;; The speakers all addressed the crowd as ""Citizens of the Southern republic,"" and said this was a pledge of Southern commerce to support the great movement of independence.;;; During the speaking processions poured in from different sections of the city, with music and cannon, each saluting the Palmetto banner.;;; On the dwellings there are hung out banners with such mottoes as ""Now or never;"" ""No step backward;"" ""The argument is ended;"" ""Stand to your arms;"" ""South Carolina goes it alone — her trumps, McGrath, Colcock and Connor — with these she claims a march.""--The tricolor flag was hung out from the theatre, with the words inserted-- Dieu et nos droits.;;; Secession badges have become universal.--Even children are all adorned by mothers with the blue ribbon.;;; All classes are arming for the contingency of coercion.;;; Revolvers and patent fire arms are selling like hot cakes.;;; Not a ship in the harbor has the federal flag flying, but far down the Bay it can still be discerned flying over Fort Moultrie.;;; There was another great demonstration tonight.;;; The stand near the pole was beautifully illuminated.;;; Speeches were made by Captain Thomas, of the State Military Academy, who assured the audience that the Cadets were ready at a moment's notice; also by Chancellor Carroll, and Messrs.

The Mon. A. M. Stephens addressed the meeting in opposition to succession.;;; We copy an abridged  report of his speech from the Augusta Dispatch:;;; ""He maintained that it would not be dishonorable to hold office under Lincoln, because he would for at least two years be a mere locum tenens in the hands of the Senate, by whom every appointment must be confirmed, and who would, therefore, have power to appoint Breckinridge Democrats in the Cabinet, and other offices.;;; He answered Mr. Toombs' argument against fishing bounties and navigation laws, by showing that the South had supported them, for the purpose of encouraging men to become sailors, and to build up our marine; but agreed with Mr. Toombs that the time had come when they should be repealed, and regretted that his distinguished friend, equalled in eloquence and power by no man in the Senate, had determined to resign.;;; Instead of staying to labor for their repeal.;;; He hoped his friend had made the declaration through his ardent impulsiveness, and would reconsider it.;;; ""In regard to the protective advantages enjoyed by workers in iron, brass and wood, they were in accordance with a tariff agreed to by North and South--Massachusetts voting with South Carolina--and the name of his honorable friend was recorded among its supporters.;;; ""The personal liberty bills, so justly odious to his friend, and to us all, had been on the statute books of the States a long time.;;; They had not become so odious until now.;;; ""He deplored the declaration of his friend, that he would appeal to his sword for redress, if his State denied it to him. (Here the stentorian voice of Mr. Toombs, who was sitting by the stand, was heard to say, 'I will,' and the hall thundered with applause in response to the revolutionary declaration.);;; ""He dwelt at some length on slavery as the cause of our difficulties, because it had been misunderstood — thought it was growing stronger every day, and he was willing to submit it even to the 'irrepressible conflict' of Seward.;;; ""The feelings and passions of the audience were evidently stronger against Mr. Stephens than for him at first, but he was listened to attentively and greeted with much applause.;;; ""At its close loud calls were made for Jackson — when Mr. Toombs ascended the stand, and waving his hat, said--Three cheers for my honored friend — than whom there is not a brighter intellect or truer heart in Georgia, and then let us adjourn."";;; This gallant act showed that though he differs with Mr. Stephens on public policy, he still cherishes him for the admiration which the noble qualities of his mind and heart command.;;; Mr. Jackson was compelled, by the calls for him, to speak, and replied to the allusions of Mr. Stephens, to the divisions at Charleston, and to other points which we cannot notice.;;; Some of the Committee who invited Mr. Stephens to speak, objected to Mr. Jackson's having the stand, when he stepped upon the top of a desk and proceeded amid a scene of confusion which was quite exciting, and came very near being serious.;;; The speech of Mr. Stephens in the main met the approval of those who are not for immediate action.;;; His policy, if carried out, will either restore the Government to a constitutional basis or force us to a dissolution.;;; The Baptist State Convention of Alabama, in session at Montgomery, on the 14th inst., adopted a preamble and resolutions, presented by Rev.

[Applause.] I hope, gentlemen, that my friends will excuse me from talking any longer.;;; But, I will say, there is not one of you, young and ardent as most of you are, that has his cause more at heart than I have, or would make greater sacrifices to secure its success.;;; [Loud and long continued applause];;; The Columbia South Carolinian, speaking of the military preparations in that State, says:;;; At Walhalla, a military company is organizing.;;; At Pendleton, a company has been formed, styled ""the Fort Hill Guards,"" eighty-seven strong, and Col.

Mail says:;;; The whole indebtedness, to the North for goods is virtually and by common consent postponed until we all get straight at the South.;;; In some places, lawyers send back Northern notes sent them for collection; everywhere business men refuse to pay such, on the ground that our interests at present require that we should have no draft on our resources.;;; Besides this, specie is pouring into our Southern Banks, as we learn on the best authority.;;; Thus, after a very little while, our monetary affairs will become as satisfactory as ever; the coin will come from Europe, and cotton will command fair prices.;;; The Charleston Courier says:;;; The difficulty lately experienced here in negotiating even the shortest exchange on New York and Boston, may have occasioned some temporary inconvenience, but its results, otherwise, have been most gratifying.;;; Every steamer from the North brings in heavy consignments of gold in payment for our cotton.;;; The stream of specie thus pouring in upon the community, must increase in a steady ratio with the causes from which it originated.;;; Its recipients will naturally re-invest it in cotton and rice, and thus we may expect soon to see our State in a position of unusual financial strength.;;; Gov. Moore, of Ala., in his reply to a request of a committee of citizens for the call of the Legislature, says:;;; In full view, and I trust a just appreciation of all my obligations and responsibilities officially and personally, to my God, my State, and the Federal Government, I solemnly declare it to be my opinion that the only hope of future security for Alabama and the other slaveholding States, is in secession from the Union.;;; I deplore the necessity for coming to such a conclusion.;;; It has been forced upon me, and these who agree with me, by a wicked and perverse party, fatally bent upon the destruction of an institution vital to the Southern States--a party whose constitutional rights we have never disturbed, and who should be our friends yet they hate as without a cause.;;; Should Alabama secede from the Union, as;;; I think she ought, the responsibility, is the eyes of all just men, will not rest upon her, but upon those who have driven her, in self-defence, to assume that position.;;; Senator Douglas on Lincoln's administration.;;; In a letter, replying to one from a number of citizens of New Orleans, asking his views relative to Lincoln's election, Senator Douglas says:;;; ""I do not anticipate, nor do I deem it possible in the present condition of the country, that, under the administration of Mr. Lincoln, any act can be perpetrated that would destroy or impair the Constitutional rights of the citizen, or invade the reserved rights of the States upon the subject of slavery; but, if I should find myself painfully mistaken on this point.;;; I have no hesitation in expressing my deliberate conviction that such an outrage would not only make the Southern people a unit, but would arouse and consolidate all the conservative elements of the North in firm and determined resistance, by overwhelming majorities.;;; In such an event, the South would occupy an impregnable position.;;; With her own people united and animated by one sentiment — the unfaltering resolve to maintain and defend their rights and liberties, as won by the blood of their fathers and guaranteed by the Constitution of their country, they could safely rely upon the justice of their cause, and confidently expect the sympathy of the civilized word and the choicest blessings of Divine Providence while struggling for the right.;;; ""Under these circumstances, I can perceive no just cause, no reasonable ground for such rash and precipitate action as would plunge into the horrors of revolution, anarchy, and bankruptcy, the happiest people, the most prosperous country, and the best government the sun of Heaven ever shed his genial rays upon.;;; To those, if any such there may be, who look upon disunion and a Southern Confederacy as a thing desirable in itself, and are only waiting for an opportunity to accomplish that which had been previously resolved upon — the election of Mr. Lincoln may furnish a pretext for precipitating the Southern States into revolution.;;; But to those who regard the Union under the Constitution as our fathers made it, the most precious legacy ever bequeathed to a free people by a patriotic ancestry, and are determined to maintain it as long as their rights and liberties, equality and honor are protected by it, the election of Mr. Lincoln, in my humble opinion, presents no just cause, no reasonable excuse, for disunion.;;; ""Having discussed all the questions at issue freely and elaborately in my addresses to the people during the recent canvass, I do not perceive that any patriotic objects can be advanced by any further public discussions on my part prior to resuming my seat in the Senate.;;; That the passions and animosities engendered by recent contests may soon give place to reason and patriotism; that calm and wise counsels may prevail, and fraternal feeling be restored; that the Constitution may be preserved inviolate, and the Union maintained forever, is the ardent hope and fervent prayer of your friend and fellow citizen,;;; ""S.

";;; Chinese Military character.;;; Chinese Military Character.;;; The Chinese have long had the reputation of being the greatest cowards in the world.-- Whether this was ever true of any but the inhabitants of certain localities, such as Shanghai, is more than problematical.;;; The obstinacy and destructiveness with which they carry on wars among themselves would seem to indicate as much pluck and stamina as any other people.;;; They quailed at first before the superior discipline and armaments of the ""outside barbarians;"" but it would seem from recent events that they have learned to face even the rifled cannon and scientific soldiership of more civilized nations.;;; Their victory over the British squadron at the Pel-Ho for is in 1859, was an achievement of which the most warlike of the Western nations might have been proud, and though the positions they then so successfully defended have just been retaken by the allies, it has been at a cost of life to the assailants which demonstrates that the Chinese have become apt pupils in ""the manly art of self-defence.""The London Times grows savagely and dolefully over the dearly purchased victory. ""That there should have been a hard fight of three hours,"" says the Times, ""is not astonishing, even with the overwhelming force and the terrible warlike engines with which the commanders of the European forces were supplied.;;; They may be reasonably supposed to have desired to acquire possession of the forts without cost of life to their own men, and to have made use of their arms of precision and rifled cannon, keeping their own men safe, and demonstrating to the enemy how useless farther resistance must be. But that the allies should have, lost so many men in killed and wounded in this business, does certainly excite our astonishment, and we shall wait with anxiety the arrival of our correspondent's account of the affair, which we hope may show that such an expenditure of life has not been unnecessarily incurred."";;; The Times inclines to the conclusion that if it be found necessary, in order to drive a Chinese force out of one of their ten thousand fortresses, the allies must incur such enormous cost and lose so many men, war in china has entirely changed its character, and the allies must apply themselves to reason upon that unpleasant fact.;;; The Boyne forts, quoth the Times, were, to look at, as tremendous and impassable fortifications as could be built, yet the English used to go in and batter them down, periodically, with three or four ships of war. In the narrow waters of the Canton river, there were fortifications just as strong in guns and masonry as those which defeated the English last year, and which have since been retaken at such cost of life; yet every now and then, when a difficulty arose, either an English or an American ship-of-war set the garrison scampering by a few shells.--""Now, it seems, all this is changed.;;; A fort in China is like a fort in Sebastopol, and a Chinese enemy exhausts all the forms of European warfare.;;; The enemy stipulates for the horrors of war, and retires with colors flying and gongs and tom-toms tormenting the atmosphere.;;; It is plain, that as we continue these wars, we are either making them more difficult, or else we are breeding a race of Admirals and Generals who make more of a difficulty in the matter."";;; If articles of peace, as is deemed probable, have followed the military operations of the allies, the Chinese military character has suffered no damage from the collision.;;; On the contrary, it is now demonstrated that the timidity formerly manifested by the Chinese towards European soldiers, was the result of the inexperience and ignorance of military science, as practiced by these nations, and the inferiority in efficient weapons as well as discipline.;;; But they are apt pupils in the arts of war as well as of peace; and numbering a population of some three hundred millions, their military subjugation, if the allies ever attempt it, will prove no child's play.;;; "
1860-11-20_article_105	1860-11-20	article	Convening the Legislature.	";;; Convening the Legislature.;;; At the present juncture and in view of the convening of the Legislature by the Governor, it may be of interest to refer to the Inaugural Message of Governor Letcher, delivered January 7th, 1860. After setting forth the unfriendly legislation upon slavery of various non-slaveholding States, and the events threatening a dissolution of the Union, he asks, ""What can be done to avert the danger?"" and says:;;; ""The only more, therefore, of remedying the evil, that occurs to me, under the Constitution, is provided in the fifth article thereof.;;; Summon a Convention of all the States, that a full and free conference may be had between the representatives of the people, elected for this purpose, and thus ascertain whether the questions in controversy cannot be settled upon some basis mutually satisfactory to both sections.;;; If such a Convention shall assemble, and after free and full consultation and comparison of opinions, they shall find that the differences between the slaveholding and non-slaveholding States are irreconcilable, let them consider the question of a peaceable separation, and the adjustment of all questions relating to the disposition of the common property between the two sections.;;; If they can be reconciled, let them adjust the terms and give them such sanctions as will render them effective.;;; ""I suggest, therefore, that you adopt resolutions in favor of the call of such a Convention, and appeal to the Legislatures of the several States to unite in the application proposed to be made to Congress, in pursuance of the provisions of the article aforesaid.;;; If the non slaveholding States shall fail or refuse to unite in the application, such failure or refusal will furnish conclusive evidence of a determination on their part to keep up the agitation, and to continue their aggressions upon us. If the Convention shall meet, and the question cannot be satisfactorily adjusted, the people of the South will clearly understand what they are to expect in the future."";;; The 5th article, to which reference is made in the above extract, is as follows:;;; ""The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to the Constitution; or, on the application of the Legislature of-two-thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of the Constitution, when notified by the Legislature of three-fourths of the several States, or by counties, in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress; provided, that no amendment which may be made prior to the year 1808, shall, in any manner, affect the first and fourth claims in the ninth section of the first article; and that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the South"" (The first clause in the ninth section, here referred to, is that which, at the instance of Massachusetts, was adopted, declaring that the slave trade shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to 1808; the fourth directs that no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken.);;; The Governor then proceeds to suggest that two of the most intelligent, discreet and experienced statesmen of Virginia shall be appointed, whose duty it shall be to visit the Legislatures of those States which have passed laws to obstruct the execution of the fugitive slave act, and insist, in the name of Virginia, upon their unconditional repeal.;;; In support of the suggestion of the appointment of a commissioner, Gov. Letcher refers to a precedent in the history of our own State, in the appointment of the distinguished Benjamin Watkins Leigh, who was commissioned to visit the Legislature of South Carolina at the time of the controversy between that State and the Federal Government.;;; The action of Virginia exerted a most happy influence at that period in preventing the threatened dissolution of the Union.;;; The Message of Gov. Letcher, which makes these recommendations, was delivered nearly a year ago, but we observe that much attention has been called of late to it in the Southern Atlantic States, and that its recommendations seem to be regarded with favor in influential quarters in that section.;;; "

The next morning his school-house was deserted, and he found a note lying on his desk, requesting his absence from the county as soon as convenient.;;; I understand he left the following day.;;; In our neighboring county, Shenandoah, Lincoln received thirteen votes.;;; This county is the residence of Geo. Rye, the Black Republican Elector for this district.;;; A letter I have just seen, from Woodstock, says:;;; ""The greatest indignation exists here against Geo. Rye, and you need not be surprised to hear of his ejectment from the county before many days."";;; A meeting was held in Woodstock on the 12th inst., at which a resolution was offered calling upon the Governor to convene the Legislature as soon as possible, to consider the action this State should take.;;; There seems to be a strong disunion sentiment existing in Shenandoah.;;; In every portion of the county there exists a great interest on the subject of religion, and several interesting revivals of religion have been and are still in progress.;;; At Dayton, the Rev. Geo. H. Ray, of the Virginia Conference, has just closed a series of meetings, during which ten or fifteen persons made a profession of religion.;;; Rev.

1860-11-20_article_374	1860-11-20	article	The War in China — the Capture of the Taku forts.	";;; The War in China — the Capture of the Taku forts.;;; The China campaign lasted from the days when the Peiho forts were taken.;;; First, the entrenched camp of the Tartars at Ling-ho was captured, in which the Tartar troops behaved gallantly, but stood no chance against the improved fire-arms of the Allies.;;; Next, the fortified town of Tong-Kee was captured, and finally the Taku forts were taken.;;; This last engagement is described as follows:;;; The plan of attack for the 21st, I believe, was that the 1st division of English, with the rest of the French, should cross the river and threaten the southern forts, while the 2d division should assault the nearest of the northern forts.;;; Accordingly, on the evening of the 20th, the 2d division moved out and took up a position in front of the said fort, but just out of range, while working parties were thrown out to erect batteries for the siege train, and reconnoitering parties examined the intervening ground as closely as possible, in order to select the most favorable points for attack.;;; The Chinese evidently had some inkling of what was going on, for they threw out showers of fireballs from the walls of the fort, in order to discover where our men were and what they were about; but whether it was that they either could not make them out, or did not consider the work they were engaged in as affecting them at all seriously, they only fired one or two guns during the night.;;; At daybreak next morning, the division then advanced, some four or five of our batteries having got into position, and pouring in a tremendous fire upon the fort with precision; while the infantry — that is to say, one wing of the Forty-fourth, Royal Marines, and Sixty-seventh, and One Hundred and Second regiment of French --advanced; the Buffs, the other wing of the Forty-fourth, and a Punjab regiment remaining in reserve, the Chinese replying with great spirit, but little apparent skill, almost all their shells bursting short, and their round shot falling every where but in the right places.;;; On arriving at a long, low embankment, about 1,500 yards from the fort, the infantry were halted and made to lie down, while the batteries were all advanced to ranges varying from 500 to 1,000 yards, and opened a still more telling fire, exploding two immense magazines inside the fort, and in about an hour nearly silencing the enemy's big guns.--The infantry then advanced again, half of the French regiment and the wing of the 44th being thrown out as sharpshooters, while one wing of the Royal Marines advanced with scaling ladders and pontoons, and the other wing, with the rest of the Sixty-seventh, followed in support.;;; As the storming party got close, the fire poured into the fort from our batteries became absolutely terrific.;;; Five or six shot or shell went flying into it every minute, and the enemy could not show themselves above the parapet at all. Through the loopholes, however, they kept up a heavy fire of gun galls, which was briskly responded to by our sharpshooters.;;; Occasionally, too, a big gun from the south side sent a round shot plump in amongst the storming party, but the tremendous explosions that had taken place inside the fort, and the terrific fire they had been subjected to, had probably paralyzed them to a great extent, and their shots were, consequently, few and far between.;;; This fort, like the wall at Tonghu, I must tell you, was also fronted by two wet ditches, both eighteen feet in width, and about eight or ten feet deep, the first one defended, moreover, by a strong abates, the second by sharp stakes on both sides.;;; On arriving at the first ditch, great difficulty was, of course, experienced in laying the pontoons, the men being knocked over here by the dozen.;;; The Engineers, under Col. Mans, and the Royal Marines, under Col. Travers, stuck to their work, however, and at last got the pontoons over the first ditch, and they shortly after made a bridge over the second.;;; I believe, with the strongest of the scaling ladders.;;; The lighter ladders were then planted against the wall, and over they went, some of the French and some of the Sixty-seventh getting in first, I believe, closely followed, however, by some Marines, and these by the rest of the storming party.;;; The French adopted a novel mode of getting in. They got up some of their Chinese coolies, and made them stand in the ditch holding scaling ladders up over their heads against the wall, and so at once crossed the second ditch and got to the top of the wall.;;; The Tartars fought bravely even after our men got in, using spears and swords, as well as matchlocks, and were shot and bayonetted in numbers.--They finally fled, however, through the embrasures on the southern side of the fort, and endeavored to make their escape to the next fort, about half mile off, few with success, however, the greater number being shot in the attempt.;;; Our loss in killed and wounded amounted to 201, 10 men being left dead on the field; 21 officers and 161 men wounded.;;; Of these, 6 officers and 65 men belonged to the 44th, 5 officers and 25 men to the Royal Marines, 7 officers and about 90 men to the 67th, and the rest to the Royal Engineers and Artillery.;;; The French left about 30 dead on the field.;;; I believe, and had upwards of 100 wounded. The Tartars must have lost, I should think, at least 3,000.;;; Their dead bodies were tying three deep in some parts of the fort, and where they attempted to escape the ground was covered with their bodies.;;; One ""pink-buttoned"" or No. 1 Mandarin was shot by Capt. Prynne, of the Royal Marines, who was one of the first officers into the fort.;;; I have since heard that it was the mandarin ""second in command,"" a certain ""Lieutenant General I,"" or some such name.;;; Among the officers who particularly distinguished themselves, I may mention Capt. Gregory and Lieut Rogers of the 44th, Lieuts. Burslem and Chaplin of the 67th, and Lieut. Kempson of the 99th, who is Aidde Camp to Brigadier Reeves, of the Fourth Brigade.;;; Some of these officers, I believe, have been recommended for the Victoria Cross, and certainly deserve it well.;;; The gallant old Brigadier Reeves was wounded in four places, I hear, but refused to be removed to the rear, and still remains with his brigade.;;; Col. Travers, of the Royal Marines, Col. Mann and Major Graham it is superfluous to mention, as the dispatches will doubtless do them all justice.;;; Young Lt. Pritchard, of the Royal Engineers, also behaved with conspicuous bravery.;;; To Sir Robert Napier and his staff we are chiefly, however, of course, indebted for the success of the day. They were always where they were wanted, and conducted the operations with an amount of coolness and intrepidity that called forth the admiration of all who saw them.;;; Sir Robert Napier had his spyglass struck out of his hand at one shot, and the heel of his boot cut away by another.;;; Lieut. Brooke, his aide-de-camp, was shot through the thigh, and all must have had numerous hairbreadth escapes, for they were greatly exposed.;;; I must not forget to mention, too, the conduct of the Chinese Coolie Corps.;;; A few of them were attached to each regiment to carry stretchers and dhoolies for the wounded.;;; They kept close to their respective regiments throughout the whole day, and never flinched even when they were close under the fort, and subjected to a very heavy fire.;;; I have only to add that, within a quarter of an hour after the English and French flags were planted in the forts, flags of truce were put up in all the other forts, and a parley was help, which ended, as I have already told you, in their unconditional surrender, and not a moment too soon either, as a terrific thunder storm shortly after came on, which drenched every one to the skin, covered the plain in a perfect swamp again, and would have rendered any further operations that day exceedingly unpleasant to say the least.;;; A wing of the Third buffs, the Punjab regiment and some artillery, were, therefore, left in possession of the fort, and the rest of the division were marched back to Taku for the night.;;; And such a march.;;; Through mud again ankle deep, and water in many places over the knee.;;; However, it is all over now, and in a few days more nearly every one will be comfortably housed either on board ship or in Tien-Tein.;;; The natives are already quite at ease with us, and are bringing in fowls, eggs, fruit, &amp;c., in abundance.;;; "

The Banks had been compelled to reduce their discounts to a degree which, at a time like this — when men are unable to pay, or inclined to hold on what they have, to meet an apprehended calamity — greatly embarrassed the business community.;;; Satisfied that something ought to be done for their relief, the Directors of the Farmers' Bank of Virginia yesterday determined to suspend specie payments.;;; The following are their proceedings:;;; ""at a meeting of the President and Directors of the Farmers' Bank of Virginia, this 30th day of November, 1860: present — Wm.

The working expenses of the Main Stem were 41 15, of the Washington Branch 37 1/3, and of the Parkersburg Branch 72¼ per cent.;;; Notwithstanding the large percentage of working expenses on the Parkersburg Branch, by its improved condition and the greater economy in working it, the advances of the Company have been reduced $36 171 04 as compared with the preceding year, and $85 752 24 as compared with 1858.;;; After all deductions — including the semi-annual dividends, $606 729; the extra dividend, $3 033 060, and the entire interest accrued thereon, $545,950 80 it is stated that the profit and loss account presents a surplus of $3,741.146 36.;;; Since the final settlement of the suits upon the extra dividend question the Board has paid in full the entire amount of accrued interest.;;; Springfield,Ill., Nov. 19--The Bank Commissioners have been in session here for several days, and have issued a call upon twenty two banks in this State for additional security, in amounts varying from three to eight per cent, of their circulation, to be paid within thirty-five days. The deficit is less than $300,000. No doubt is entertained that the banks embraced in the call will promptly respond.;;; The circulation of the other banks of the State, numbering nearly one hundred, is amply secured.;;; The Baltimore American's commercial review, dated Monday, says:;;; There is no improvement in the general condition of financial affairs to-day.;;; There is still an active demand for money, at the full current rates of last week; but, at the same time, there is no additional pressure experienced by borrowers — While the future remains in a position of so much doubt and uncertainty, no one can expect to see any radical improvement; at the same time, we remark nothing partaking of uneasiness among our merchants, and unless the pending agitations still further disturb and derange commerce.;;; no serious dangers are apprehended.;;; The Banks are discounting but little to day, although they are doing as much as they can for their regular customers.;;; It is hardly worth while to give the rates for paper on the street, as there is nothing touched by capitalists except strictly first-class endorsed-paper, and but little doing even with that.;;; At the Corn Exchange we have never seen the market so much depressed as it was to-day.;;; There was a good inquiry for Flour for export, but in the present unsettled state of monetary affairs holders were not anxious to sell, and shippers were not generally prepared to buy for cash, which were the terms prescribed by the former.;;; Notwithstanding there was nothing done, holders would have been willing to accept a decline of 25 cts. per bbl for cash, but even at this reduced rate there was no disposition to operate.;;; Grain was in larger supply to-day than it has been for some months past, and although Wheat and Corn were wanted for export, still shippers seemed disinclined to go in, the market being so unsettled.;;; The offerings of both were heavy, adding up fully 90 000 bushels, but not one-third of this could be sold even at a decline of 10 cts, for the former, and 5 cts. per bushel for the latter, the market closing heavy for both.;;; In other branches of trade we have no movement to note save in Coffee, which was in more active demand than it has been for some weeks past, but rates are decidedly lower, viz: full ½ cent per lb.;;; The N. Y. Journal of Commerce, of Monday afternoon, says:;;; The money market opened without improvement, and it was exceedingly difficult, during the morning hours, to borrow money at any price.-- Toward meridian there was a call for a general meeting of Bank officers, and as it was understood that a proposal would be made to agree upon an expansion of 5@7 per cent upon the present line of discounts, a more hopeful feeling prevailed in the street.;;; It is argued that as there is no export demand for gold, the Banks can safely lend seven or eight millions more than they have now under discount, and that this would at once relieve the community.;;; Some are for advancing two or three millions to the bankers for the purchase of Exchange, and others favor the purchase to this extent directly by the Banks without the intervention of the bankers.;;; Something may be agreed upon, but not in season for this edition of our paper.;;; Foreign Exchange is still irregular; produce bills have sold as low as 95; bankers are selling as low as 108, but first class sterling can be bought at 103.;;; The stock market is unsettled, and prices are very much lower for most descriptions.;;; Two or three on the list having been sold largely short.;;; were supported at about Saturday's rates.;;; At the First Board Tenn 6's declined 1½; North Carolina 6's (from last sale at the Board.) 9; Missouri 6's 3¼; Erie 4th mort.;;; 8; Mich.

1860-11-21_article_388	1860-11-21	article	Nullification in the North.	";;; Nullification in the North.;;; The old law of Congress, passed soon after the adoption of the Constitution, says, that when a fugitive slave escapes and is found in another State, ""any magistrate of a county, city, or town corporate,"" in such States, besides Judges of the U. S. Courts, may, upon proper proofs, ""either by oral testimony, or affidavit,"" issue a warrant for ""removing the said fugitive from labor to the State or Territory from which he fled."" It was a simple and easy way of complying with the Constitution, which declares that ""no person held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such labor or service may be due."";;; But in 1814, when the Abolition element began to take the control of the opponents of the Democratic party, the Legislature of Connecticut nullified this enactment of Congress, and declared that.;;; ""No judge, justice of the peace, or other officer appointed under the authority of this State, shall be authorized, as such, to issue, or serve, any warrant or process for the arrest or detention, of any person escaping into this State, claimed to be a fugitive from labor or service as a slave, under the laws of any other State."";;; This was flat nullification — nothing short of it — so far as the State magistrates were concerned.;;; Congress had said, as we have seen, that ""any magistrate of a county, city or town"" might comply with the Constitution in this respect; but the Legislature of Connecticut declared, in the face of it, that ""no judge, justice of the peace, or other officer appointed under authority of this State,"" shall do anything of the Rind.;;; Thus matters stood till 1850, when Congress passed an additional act to obviate the nullifying enactments which Connecticut and other States acting under abolition influence had passed.;;; The law of Congress of 1850 therefore provided — since the nullifying States had refused to let their magistrates act — that U. S. commissioners might perform the same duties as had by the old law been conferred on State magistrates.;;; And it was to meet this last law of Congress, and render it as nugatory as the first, that our Legislature passed their law of 1854.;;; The Courier says, ""Our law (1854) has nothing to do with a case of reclamation,"" But it has a great deal to do with it, if what was said in debate by the friends of the bill — and which we have already published — is to be taken as showing their intentions.;;; They said it was intended to prevent the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law in this State.;;; The law does not say so on its face.;;; It is adroitly worded, and has the popular title of ""An act for the defence of liberty in this State."" It says that ""every person who shall falsely and maliciously pretend that any free person entitled to freedom is a slave, or owes service or labor to any person or persons, with intent to procure or aid, or assist in procuring the forcible removal of such free persons from this State, shall pay a fine of $3,000, and be imprisoned five years in the Connecticut State Prison."";;; It also declares that on the trial of one prosecuted for this offence — he must prove his innocence by at least two credible witnesses — and that no despotism shall be admitted as evidence.;;; The way it will work is as this: A man comes here, say from Alabama, to reclaim his fugitive slave, and brings with him the necessary affidavits or depositions, which the act of Congress says is proper evidence to make out his claim.;;; He goes before a United States Judge or Commissioner, and makes out his claim by the proofs required by law, and the Judge or Commissioner on that proof makes out a warrant for the fugitive's return.;;; As soon as this is done, the negro, or some abolitionist from him, can turn round and make complaint to a Grand Juror of the town, for the arrest of his master, and stop his journey homeward.;;; On this complaint, the negro would be a witness to testify that he was not a slave — though the United States Judge or Commissioner had just before decided that he was one.;;; On the trial of this complaint, the white man would not be allowed to use such proof as had established his rights before the United States Judge or Commissioner — for the State law says that ""no deposition should be admitted as evidence."" If he is fortunate enough to find here a substantial and good witness, who knows and testifies that the fugitive is a runaway slave — even that, the law of Connecticut says, shall not be sufficient.;;; He must send home and have another good witness brought here, or there is no escape for him — for this law requires ""the testimony of at least two credible witnesses,"" to overcome the negro's story.;;; What would become of the runaway in the meantime?;;; His master being among strangers, may be locked up in jail — for want of bonds — and the story of the Jerry rescues tells the rest.;;; Who would encounter such risks — with such a law with its five thousand dollars' fine, and its five years State prison punishment, hanging over him?;;; No more effectual way of nullifying the Constitution, and the laws of Congress, could have been devised.--New Haven Register.;;; Condition of Virginia Banks.;;; "

";;; English view of the late Royal visit.;;; The London Post has an interesting article on the visit of the Prince to the United States, which undoubtedly represents fairly the sentiments of the masses in England towards this country.;;; We have selected portions of the article as follows:;;; ""Time has healed all the wounds contracted in the war of independence, and the Americans, who, after all, are really fond of England, are glad to have an opportunity of showing friendship, respect, and hospitality to this country's future king.;;; That our Prince of Wales should have been received in the country which calls itself the headquarters of Republican Government, is only another instance of what surprising things some men may live to see. There are men living who can remember the heartburning and bitterness that followed the American war, when the very name of king and the very idea of monarchy was scarcely mentioned without expressions of contempt.;;; Those feelings have passed away, and in their stead have come a warm and outspoken regard not only for English people, but for English princes."";;; ""The son and heir of Queen Victoria, though traveling in a private capacity, is welcomed and feted along every inch of his journey.;;; all press to look at him, all are proud of his coming, and wish him to carry away only pleasant and affectionate recollections of a markable tour.;;; Such a visit is a great epoch in the young Prince's life, the recollections of which can never fade from his memory.;;; He may visit Canada and the States again before he is King of England, and be as well received; he may see India and other portions of his mother's vast dominions, and wherever he goes he will be honored with the loyalty and love of his mother's subjects; but nothing, one would think, will ever equal in depth, clearness and freshness, the impressions of this first transatlantic trip.;;; But it is scarcely less an epoch in the history of the United States.;;; It is a middle point between two eras.;;; The old will compare the public feeling now displayed with what they knew in their youth; the young will recount it in years to come as a great event to date from."";;; ""What a past is that which the history of the United States presents!;;; What a growth!;;; What a progress from the disadvantages of a distant and ill-governed colony to all the strength and influence of a great nation!;;; To its fertile soil men have flocked from all parts of the world, and been absorbed into its mixed population.;;; They have penetrated the dense woods, crossed the prairies, cleared the forests, spanned the gigantic rivers, and planted themselves in all directions.;;; Scattered farms have grown into flourishing settlements, which again have increased into towns, have become centres of commerce and communication, have attached round them the industry and enterprise of new comers, have been brought near to other cities by the railroad, and nearer still by the telegraph, have combined their political influence, organized themselves into States, and by their admission into the Union have become component members of one of the richest, most prosperous, and most powerful nations in the world.;;; All this has happened within living memory.;;; Indeed, it is happening every day. It never stops.--Daily the population is augmented from without as well as from within.;;; Every day new havoc is made with the old trees.;;; Civilization presses farther and farther into the remote West, and fresh sources of wealth are opened up. There is no want of space.;;; If population presses too heavily in one place, a cheap and hasty migration to another rectifies the inconvenience.;;; Labor is welcome everywhere, and everywhere it is well repaid.;;; New states of society, creating new wants, are continually supplied by new developments of industry and new combinations of the inventive faculty.;;; Nor is all this enterprise confined to the States only.;;; There is not a port or a market in the world where the American merchant is not represented — American ships, American shoes, American clocks, American cotton and American leather are everywhere."";;; ""Is there any definable limit to all this forth putting?;;; We know of none.;;; As America has grown, so she will continue to grow.--Let what will be in store for America, as long as she cherishes such hearty feeling toward this country as she has expressed by her attention to our popular young Prince, she may count to a very large extent upon the love and sympathy of the English people.;;; Among those hospitable friends we will for the present leave him, thankful for the welcome he has received, which can be exceeded only by one other — his welcome home."";;; "

Journal contains a letter from Wirt Court-House, which gives an account of the traordinary discoveries of oil now being made in Western Virginia.;;; He gives some instances as follows:;;; Mr. Karns leased a piece of ground (two acres,) from Mr. Rathbone, only six miles above mine, for twenty years, and at the depth of 150 feet reached a vein of oil which yields 15 barrels, of 40 gallons each, per day, worth, at the lowest price, 25 cents per gallon, and for which lease of two acres he (Mr. K.) has been offered $70,000. This well has been in operation, without any decrease in quantity, for over three months. Mr. Rathbone, after he saw the success of Mr. Karns' well, sank one himself below Karns', on the river, and I was there the evening he commenced pumping first.;;; He commenced at 6 o'clock P. M., and pumped until 6 o'clock A. M., just twelve hours, and filled a cistern containing 130 barrels of 40 gallons each — that is to say, 5,200 gallons of pure oil, worth 25 cents per gallon.;;; Rathbone's well still continued to pour out the same quantity of oil up to last night, but that they had to stop pumping for want of cisterns and barrels; and that Mr. Karns told him that I had the best and surest prospect for oil next to Rathbone's, on the river.;;; They have made another discovery in a hill or rather mountain on Hugh's River, a tributary of the Kanawha, and distant from here some twelve miles. It is the discovery of oil coal.;;; Mr. Mattingly, who owns it, told me himself (for we traveled together through this county a day, prospecting,) that the vein is 1,000 feet in thickness by actual measurement.;;; How wonderful are all these things, and yet how astonishing that they have not been discovered before; but you must remember that this is comparatively a new country, and that the early settlers were neither literary nor scientific men. Put this coal on a shovel and hold it over the fire until it becomes hot, and it all melts and turns to oil.;;; There is every prospect for a speedy improvement of this river, either by sluicing or damming, or slack water navigation, so as to introduce steamboats.;;; The fact is, they can not get their oil off fast enough by any other means, unless they build a railroad to unite with the Northwestern stem, a distance of twelve miles, and that is strongly talked of.;;;

The character of the rocks on the side of the mountains are evidently volcanic, and large dark broken masses have every appearance of laVa.;;; The water is conducted from the springs to reservoirs on the tops of the bathhouses, so arranged that you may have the douse, shower, plunge or vapor bath, just as you please.;;; The water is quite soft, and as clear and transparent as crystal.;;; When you first bathe in it, it seems impossible to bear the heat, but you gradually get accustomed to it, and find it very delightful.;;; It is remarkably pleasant to drink, and when taken hot is equal to the best Chou-chong.;;; What is singular, even when tepid it has no nauseating effect.;;; With a little salt and pepper, it makes a very good consume, or thin chicken broth!;;;

""time !"" Finally, bowing himself off, Miller left the stage, jumping to the floor with the alacrity of a fresh man, and was escorted to his room by his friends, amid the clapping of hands, and three cheers from the enthusiastic crowd.;;; After having been vigorously rubbed for about half an hour, he was put to bed, and fell asleep as calmly as a child, the moment he touched it.;;; "

The stand bore above the speaker's desk the motto, ""The Union, the Constitution, and the Enforcement of the Laws,"" and on either side the portraits of John Bell, of Tennessee, and Edward Everett, of Massachusetts.;;; The stand was appropriately dressed with flags, and lit with full jets of gas.

";;; Touching the money Nerve.;;; The face of Europe now presents, as it has presented for the last ten years, the most extraordinary military armaments.;;; The whole continent looks like one vast camp.;;; From three to four millions of armed men are supported by the various Governments, at an enormous expense.;;; In fact, such have been the vast amounts expended in preparing for war by all the continental nations with the exception of Prussia, that, according to the Liverpool Mercury, scarcely one of them is in a condition to face the additional expenditure of actual combat.;;; Not one of them, it is alleged, can raise more money by taxation, either direct or indirect, or can borrow money in large amounts except at ruinous interest in the open money market.;;; Austria, says the Mercury, cannot borrow at all; Russia can only obtain small sums, and that at a high rate of interest; France can borrow, but even in time of peace her three per cents are only worth 68, whilst those of England are worth 93.;;; England, in the opinion of the Mercury, could carry on war for a dozen years, at the rate of a hundred millions a year, without any danger of national bankruptcy, and it is the knowledge of this that is likely to save her from the evils of actual war. Nevertheless, she is expending seventy millions a year in time of peace to save her from the necessity of expending a hundred millions a year during a long period of war. This is an enormous sum for a peace establishment.;;; The Mercury confesses that it is only as a means of counteracting greater evils that it can be looked to without serious alarm, and that it may be reasonably doubted whether even the unrivalled wealth and industry of Great Britain would be able to bear it if it is to be permanent, while it has some ""faint hope"" that it will not be.-- Even this ""faint hope"" is founded not on any expectations that the Governments of the continent, whose enormous military and naval expenditures are the apology for British expenditure, will become more reasonable, but on the belief that the purses of their subjects will be emptied and their patience exhausted before those of Great Britain.;;; If this be the only hope of retrenchment in British expenditure, it will be necessary for British statesmen to husband their resources and nurse the various sources of revenue with great care and perseverance.;;; We should imagine that, under such circumstances, their relations with the United States would be well worth attending to. The vast manufacturing interests of Great Britain are dependent on the regular production of American staples, and it is about time that she should discourage the crusade within her borders against the labor by which those staples are produced.-- If she has no regard to any interests but her own, her own interests are reason enough, especially in view of the equally signs of the times, why she should give a quietus to Exeter Hall.;;; "

Y.) journals, in which he barbecues his Excellency alive, and does not spare the seasoning.;;; He remindshim that one of the great points urged by his friends in his canvass for Governor was his humble origin, and marvels that he should so soon have forgotten the rock whence he was hewn.;;; It is quite marvellous that an astute and hard-headed politician like Thurlow Weed should advise Gov. Morgan, in inviting his military staff to dine with the Prince of Wales, to exclude one of them on account of being a hotel keeper.;;; Yet the most cunning men in the world sometimes commit the greatest absurdities.;;; From the manner in which Horace Gresley floored Weed at Chicago, and this last superlative piece of nonsense, we suspect that Thurlow is getting in his dotage.;;; The Prince of Wales, on his visit to America, laid aside not only his title, but the strict etiquette of courts, and recognized all American citizens as standing in truth and reality on the platform of equality which they profess to occupy.;;; Moreover, the hotel keepers of the United States, in general, are as intelligent and every way gentlemanly a class of men as their guests, and in Albany, we should think, especially in the winter season, when the Legislature is in session, much more so. The New York Herald mentions, in connection with the case of Gov. Morgan and Gen. Mitchell, that when LordSydenham came over as Governor General, he was for some time the guest of a gentleman who kept a hotel in Toronto, and who did everything in his power to make him as comfortable as possible.;;; After the government house had been prepared for the Governor's residence, he removed to it, and gave a dinner to the Mayor and Corporation, of which body the hotel keeper was a member.;;; The Governor General treated his fomer landlord with marked courtesy, and always asked him to the government house on festive occasions.;;; When it is remembered that the Governor General of Canada is the immediate representative of royalty, and always travels with regal surroundings, the conduct of Lord Sydenham comes out in rather bold relief against that of Gov. Morgan.;;; "

Hale was discovered to be on fire.--The boats from the American vessels of war were immediately sent to her assistance, and it was by their praise worthy exertions that the vessel and cargo were saved.;;; To Captain Rudd, of the Lancaster, who, by his promptness on the occasion, too much praise cannot be awarded.;;; Yesterday a most frightful accident occurred in the Dry Dock at San Lorenzo, involving the entire loss of the Peruvian frigate Callao, (Apurimac) and almost the entire destruction of the dock, and a fearful loss of life.;;; The particulars of this lamentable affair are, as far as I can gather, as follows: It having been deemed advisable to dock the ship in order to examine her copper and other trifling things, the Engineer of the dock was asked if she could be taken on with her battery, provisions and crew on board: his opinion was that the dock could not raise her with that weight, consequently her guns were landed, yards sent down and top-gallant masts struck, retaining her provisions, magazine and crew on board, and in this state she entered the dock at 10 ½ A.M. There was a very large concourse of persons went over to witness the operation.--The Government steamer Ucayah conveyed the President, Minister of War, and a large number of invited guests.;;; Upon the arrival of the President the vessel began to enter the dock, and was soon placed in her proper position, the pumps were set to work — everything up to the present moment went well.;;; The keel of the frigate took the chocks of the platform, and she began to ascend out of the water.;;; Owing to her great depth of keel the chocks did not act as any support whatever on her bilge, therefore the ship was simply balanced upon her keel, and so long as she could be kept steady in that position she was safe, but her crew were on board, constantly moving from one side to the other, the ship being already top-heavy, this caused her to give one or two slight rolls, and then she pitched over on the starboard beam; at the second surge the three masts snapped about half-way up from the deck, her starboard ports being open, she rapidly filled with water, and here began a scene of horror impossible to describe.;;; The water was filled with men and women, wounded, dying, all screaming for help; boats were promptly sent to their assistance, or the loss of life would have been still more fearful.;;; Of the number that were below at the time very few escaped, and their cries for help were terrible, but that which was most heart-rending was the poor sick in the hospital, who, helpless with disease, could do naught but scream for that help that none could render them.;;; Up to the present time of writing it is not known how many have been lost, but it cannot fall short of one hundred and fifty.;;; The wounded that could be removed who did not require amputation were brought over to Callao, the rest remaining on the Island.--The number of broken heads, arms and legs is great.;;; Capt. Keer, of the English ship Golconda lowered his boats, and did good service in saving some thirty or forty lives.;;; The Callao was a fine 44-gun frigate.;;; She is about six years old — the vessel is a total loss, being entirely under water; the dock may also be considered as done for, it having failed as a commercial speculation, and the present disaster may be considered as the last of the Callao Dry Dock.;;; Panama.;;;  An official question has arisen between the United States and British naval forces in Panama, which is of considerable interest.;;; It has been occasioned by the order given to the guards from H. B. M.'s ship Clio, stationed at the British and French Consulates since the late riot, to hail all persons passing those houses.;;; Several foreigners have been stopped by the sentry, and on Saturday an American officer, and subsequently an American citizen, have been arrested for refusing to respond to the sentry, whilst passing through the public street.;;; The matter was brought before Flag officer Montgomery, in command of the U.

The position of the Chinese on the Pei-ho river is represented to be a very strong one, and, in addition to these fortifications, they have two bodies of troops, one numbering 10,000, and the other from 40,000 to 50,000.;;; It was expected that the attack would certainly be made on the 12th or 13th, as a longer delay might result in a great deal of sickness, from the malaria of the marshes.;;; Mr. Ward, our Minister, was with the Allied fleet, as was our entire naval force on the station.;;; This fact gave great dissatisfaction to the American residents of Shanghai, who could not see the necessity of two American war steamers at the Pei-ho, especially when Shanghai was threatened by a rebel force of 20,000, which was reported to be only four miles off.

1860-11-05_article_93	1860-11-05	article	Thackeray's George IV.	";;; Thackeray's George IV.;;; Thirty-eight years ago, when George IV. was but a new King, upon the occasion of his visit to Ireland, Byron wrote:    ""Spread — spread for Vitellius the royal repast, Till the gluttonous despot be stuffed to the gorge.;;; And the roar of his drunkards proclaims him, at last.;;; The Fourth of the fools and oppressors called George."";;; Bitter as this language is — exceeded in bitterness only by what precedes and follows it in the same poem — posterity has endorsed the judgment pronounced upon the royal glutton by the indignant bard.;;; Mr. Thackeray is the last who has spoken, and the only difference between the contemporary satirist and the essayist of the present day, is, that the former attacks the living monarch with the stern indignation of a patriot, while the latter treats the dead King as a fit subject for no sentiment stronger than derision.;;; All the laughing devils under Mr. Thackeray's control — and their name is legion — are let loose upon the memory of the dead voluptuary.;;; ""To make a portrait of him,"" he says, ""at first seemed a matter of small difficulty.;;; There is his coat, his star, his wig, his countenance simpering under it; with a slate and a piece of chalk, I could at this very desk perform a recognizable likeness of him. And yet, after reading of him in scores of volumes, hunting him through old magazines and newspapers; having him here at a ball, there at races, and so forth, you find you have nothing — nothing but a coat and wig, and a mask smiling below it — nothing but a great simulacrum.--His sire and grandsire were men. One knows what they were like; what they would do in given circumstances; that on occasion they fought, and demeaned themselves like tough, good soldiers.;;; They had friends whom they liked according to their natures; enemies whom they hated fiercely; passions, and actions, and individualities of their own. The sailor King who came after George was a man; the Duke of York was a man, big, burly, loud, jolly, cursing, courageous.;;; But this George what was he?;;; I look through all his life and recognize but a bow and a grin.--I try and take him to pieces, and I find silk stockings, padding, stays, a coat with frogs and a fur collar, a star and blue ribbon, a pocket-handkerchief prodigiously scented, one of Truefitt's best nutty-brown wigs reeking with oil, a set of teeth and a huge black stock, under-waistcoats, more under-waistcoats, and then nothing.;;; I know of no sentiment that he ever distinctly uttered.;;; Documents are published under his name, but people wrote them --private letters, but people spelled them.;;; He put a great George P. or George R. at the bottom of the page, and fancied he had written the paper.;;; Some bookseller's clerk, some poor author, some man did the work; saw to the spelling; cleaned up the slovenly sentences, and gave the lax, maudlin, slipslop a sort of consistency.;;; He must have had an individuality; the dancing master whom he emulated, nay, surpassed — the wig-maker who curled his toupee for him — the tailor who cut his coats, had that.;;; But, about George, one can get at nothing actual.;;; The outside, I am certain, is pad and tailor's work; there may be something behind, but what?;;; We cannot get at the character; no doubt never shall.;;; Will men of the future have nothing better to do, than to unswathe and interpret that royal old mummy?;;; I own I once used to think it would be good sport to pursue him, fasten on him, and pull him down.;;; But now I am ashamed to mount and lay good dogs on, to summon a full field, and then to hunt the poor game."";;; And yet this poor creature had among his friends and intimates some of the most distinguished men of his day, while he was still but Prince of Wales, and had not even assumed the reins as Regent.;;; Heartless and treacherous as he was known to be, utterly destitute of all principle, and profligate to a degree too scandalous even to be alluded to, he had not only such men as Burke, Pitt and Sheridan among his friends, but even such as Wilberforce and Sir Walter Scott. Cringing was the besetting weakness of the last, and his abject flattery of George IV. leaves a blot upon his memory which it is painful to all men to contemplate.;;; Well do we recollect the feeling of contemptuous indignation with which his admirers read of his conduct in the newspapers, when George IV. visited Edinburgh — how the monarch drank his health — how he took the glass and put it in his pocket, declaring that it should be transmitted to his latest posterity — and how he sat down upon it and crushed it, to the infinite amusement of everybody but himself, and to the serious danger of the sitting portion of his body.;;; They held down their heads in silence, or vented their indignation in curses — for their ideal of the man was formed upon the model which he had himself furnished in the numerous characters he had drawn.;;; Nevertheless, it is but proper to say, that in his own person, Scott was a man of sterling independence.;;; He asked nobody to give him anything for which he was not willing to work.;;; He asked favors of no man, least of all of the King.;;; He would be silent for a whole evening, if the merest numskull of a peer chanced to be of the company, but he would not consent to be patronized by any peer that ever existed.;;; The peculiar turn of Scott's mind brought him to his knees whenever a nobleman was present.;;; That accounts for his subserviency.;;; But how to account for Fox and Sheridan! There lies the difficulty.;;; Perhaps it was to be found in the personal fascinations of the man; for that he possessed great powers of entertaining his friends, in his younger days, is incontestable, in spite of all Byron and Thackeray have said.;;; Among other talents, Raikes tells us, upon the authority of the Duke of Wellington, that he possessed the power of mimicry in an almost unequaled degree, and though this is a very low, still it is a very entertaining talent.;;; But besides, he was the best raconteur of his day, and his budget of anecdotes was uncommonly large.;;; In the course of this lecture, Mr. Thackeray alludes to a well known circumstance in the life of George IV., upon which Raikes, on the authority, we believe, of Sir Henry Halford, is much more explicit.;;; He was certainly deranged — as mad as his father had been — during the greater part of the last years of his life.;;; When in this situation he fancied that he had personally commanded in all the campaigns of the Peninsula — in other words, had filled the place of Wellington--and actually related anecdotes of battles, sieges, and marches, as of events that occurred under his own eye. His ministers kept the secret from the world and reigned for him, as Pitt had done for his father.;;; Mr. Thackeray does not allude to his general madness, but contents himself with alleging a sort of monomania.;;; He says: ""I believe it is certain about George IV. that he had heard so much of the war, knighted so many people, and worn such a prodigious quantity of Marshal's uniforms, cocked hats, cock's feathers, and scarlet and bullion in general, that he actually fancied he had been present in some campaigns, and, under the name of Gen. Brock, led a tremendous charge of the German legion at Waterloo."";;; "

";;; Mexico.;;; It is remarked, with truth, by the New Orleans Picayune, that the soil of Mexico has drunk up the best blood of its people, and the country is scarcely more populous to-day than it was when it threw off the Spanish yoke.--In Central America, civil war is the rule, and peace is the exception.;;; In South America, the bloody role of Revolution is acted with a dreary and horrible monotony.;;; These statements of our New Orleans contemporary are the literal historical truth; and why, we would ask, is it so?;;; Why? The Constitutions of the Southern Republics are almost exact transcripts of our own; they have all the forms of liberty and law, but the spirit is dead, if indeed it ever existed.;;; It is not in free Constitutions to create freemen; the Constitution must be the product of the character, genius and customs of a race, or it will perish as soon as born.;;; Our Anglo-Saxon race has been trained for centuries in the principles and practice of self-government, and it is this training, not the free forms — which have grown out of it, and are but the symbol of the inward life — which has given success thus far to our grand experiment of Liberty and Law. What reflecting man can look at the eternal and bloody conflicts of Mexico, Central and South America; at the national impoverishment and degradation of the whole continent, with the exception of the great monarchy of Brazil, and imagine that political equality is alike a blessing to men of all nations, or that the capacity of self-government can be conveyed by the adoption of constitutional forms?;;; Republican institutions are no more fit for all people, than the same coat is fit for all backs, as the repeated trials and repeated failures in Europe have often proved, and will prove again as often as they are attempted.;;; The condition of Mexico is every day becoming worse and worse, instead of better.--Civil war rages through the whole length and breadth of that unhappy country, dividing cities, towns, villages, and even families, exhibiting the horrible spectacle sometimes of father and son arrayed in battle against each other, and brother shedding the blood of brother.;;; Deeds of cruelty are occasionally perpetrated by the military commanders, which make the blood run cold.;;; It is reported that Gen. Miramon has lately whipped to death a woman, and that woman in a situation which the most brutal generally respect, for the offence of endeavoring to effect the escape of her husband from prison.;;; If this be true, no vengeance could be too great for such a monster; yet such are the furious passions always engendered by civil war. As brethren offended are the most bitter of all enemies, so civil war is the most merciless and vindictive of all contests.;;; To that more than to any other kind of hostilities, apply the words of the dramatist--    ""Imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews; summon up the blood."";;; War, in its best aspect, is full of horrors unspeakable, and presents a lively image of the crimes and miseries of the infernal pit; but it has its glories and its consolations when undertaken in a just cause against a foreign foe. But civil wars, like those in which Mexico is now engaged, benefit nobody but political and military adventurers, brigands and burglars; its battles establish no principle and produce no fruits, except the weeds, thorns and briars which mark its crimson path; its victories are victories over itself; its garlands are wet with fraternal blood, and its battle stains smell of murder.;;; May Heaven avert from this country such a catastrophe!;;; "

1860-11-05_article_390	1860-11-05	article	Life Insurance, &amp;c.	";;; The Art of Fighting the French Army.;;; Prince Frederick Charles, of Prussia, has just published a pamphlet, under the title of The Art of Fighting the French Army. The royal author gives as the first principle of the French system of warfare, that the French soldier always marches forward; the second, he says, is, that moral is superior to physical force.;;; So Marshal Canrobert, when he had a coup de main on his hands in the Crimea, always asked his soldiers: ""Do you feel equal to it?"" They never answered ""No;"" and the promise which they themselves had given to their General was the guarantee of their success.;;; The third principle of the French, according to the Prince, is to hold themselves in a serried column against an enemy which is badly disciplined and unaccustomed to military manŒavres; and, on the contrary, to fight with disordered ranks and like skirmishers when they have to do with regular and well-disciplined troops.;;; The fourth French principle is, never to defend themselves passively.;;; Of this the Prince says: ""If it happens that the French are attacked by a close column, they proceed in this way, and it is especially excellent when the attack is not supported by a corps de reservé. The French riflemen gave way at the point of attack; the attacking column, imagining that this is the commencement of a retreat, pushes on; but soon the riflemen present a new front --one or two columns advance.;;; The sharp-shooters surround the enemy on all sides; he hesitates; he loses time; he cannot turn back; there he is compelled to fight, and is abandoned to his fate.;;; The French soldiers are ordered in this case not to kill any more, but to make prisoners, because a soldier can take five or six prisoners in the time required to kill one man."";;; ""It is a principle,"" says the Prince, ""in the French army that an attack, when once resolved upon, can never be executed too soon or too rapidly.;;; In Italy, fire seldom lasted a quarter of an hour before they came to the bayonet, and oftentimes they did not burn a cartridge during the attack.;;; It appears, now, that the French attack at a full run, to which they exercised during peace, so that, when they reach the enemy, they are not out of breath."" The Prince claims many of these principles as of Prussian origin.;;; He believes that they are not even the product of the French national character, and that the temperament of the Prussian soldiers is admirably adapted to their adoption.;;; In conclusion, he proposes --first, to employ riflemen by columns of one company each; second, to dispose the army in depth rather than in breadth, which increases the power of resistance on the flanks, and prevents a rapid loss of men; and thirdly, the disposition of an army as much as possible like the squares on a chess-board, which is the best means of sustaining the impetuous attack of such troops as the Zouaves and Turcos made on a full run with the bayonet.;;; The Prince's last sentence is --""May we consider these principles while there is yet time.

1860-11-07_article_118	1860-11-07	article	The Press in England.	";;; The Press in England.;;; The Philadelphia North American publishes an extended notice from the foreign journals of the present state of the press in England, from which it appears that the English press has, within the last few years, undergone an extraordinary transformation.;;; The abolition of the tax on advertisements, followed by the repeal of the stamp duty, has exonerated it from all the heavy burdens (the duty on paper excepted) which weighed upon it. The number of newspapers has almost doubled, and their circulation has considerably increased. --It is no longer possible to ascertain the exact circulation of each journal.;;; The most contradictory statements are in vogue, even in the newspaper world itself, as well as in that of letters; so that the extent of the circulation of this or that journal is exaggerated or depreciated in such a manner as to put all calculation to flight.;;; Before the abolition of the stamp duty, it was easy to ascertain, almost to a copy, by means of the reports periodically published, what was the circulation of each newspaper; but now no newspapers are stamped except those destined to be sent by the post into the country.;;; The mass of the daily or weekly issue circulates free of stamp duty; so that the statements still published respecting the stamped editions of the newspaper will not give us the least idea of their real circulation.;;; One journal, for instance, may have a considerable circulation, and yet issue no stamped edition, its sale being limited to London; while another, with a far inferior circulation, sends at least one-third of its issue to be stamped in order to be sent to different parts of the United Kingdom.;;; We give the names of some of the principal daily and weekly journals of the metropolis of which the stamped editions are given in the latest report published by order of the House of Commons.;;; The return includes the number of copies of journals of the United Kingdom stamped between  December, 1857, and June, 1859. We only quote the returns for one quarter, selecting those papers which are the best known.;;; Of the daily journals, the number of stamped copies issued between the 1st April and the 30th June, 1859, were:;;; the Times816,058;;; the Morning Post72,500;;; the Morning Herald51,000;;; the Globe50,000;;; the Daily News49,789;;; the Morning Advertiser20,000;;; the Morning Chronicle15,000;;; the Standard11,000;;; the Morning Star9,000;;; of the weekly journals stamped during the same period, (1st April to 30th June, 1859,) the numbers were:;;; the Illustrated London News432,923;;; the News of the World118,400;;; the Record114,500;;; Bell's Weekly Messenger113,000;;; Bell's Life in London83,000;;; the Weekly Dispatch75,000;;; the Weekly Times62,000;;; the Saturday Review53,000;;; the Athenæum24,000;;; these numbers, which have reference to the stamped copies only, do not, it is said, give an accurate representation of the circulation of these different journals.;;; A more certain guide, it is observed, would be the best report published previously to the abolition of the stamp duty, which took place in 1855; for at that time every number of each journal had to be stamped, according to law. The returns of the first six months of 1855, show what was the exact issue of every newspaper in the United Kingdom.;;; Although the report embraces a period of six months, a very simple process of division will enable us to ascertain the daily issue of each journal.;;; According to this report, we find that the number of copies respectively issued by the daily journals, between the 31st of December, 1854, and the 1st of July, 1855, was as follows:;;; the Times9,175,788;;; Morning Advertiser1,034,618;;; Daily News825,000;;; Morning Herald554,000;;; Globe540,000;;; Morning Post455,000;;; Morning Chronicle401,500;;; Weekly papers.;;; Illustrated London News3,393,151;;; News of the World2,885,000;;; Weekly Times1,993,853;;; Weekly Dispatch1,052,450;;; Bell's Life in London466,500;;; Bell's Weekly Messenger504,000;;; Record205,000;;; Athenæum81,000;;; Although these returns of the stamped issue give no perfectly reliable bases as to the circulation of this or that journal, yet it is the opinion of an intelligent and practical observer, who has taken considerable trouble to obtain results, that the following figures approximate the truth: Daily circulation of the Times, about fifty thousand; Morning Advertiser, seven thousand; Daily News, from three thousand to three thousand five hundred; Morning Post, same; Morning Herald, about two thousand; Morning Chronicle, one thousand to fifteen hundred; Globe, from two thousand to twenty-five hundred; Sun, from fifteen hundred to two thousand.;;; With the exception of the Daily News, which has recently reduced its price to threepence, all these journals are sold at four pence each.--The circulation of the penny newspapers is much more considerable.;;; According to some, the Daily Telegraph issues daily 40,000 copies' or, according to others, 50,000 or 65,000; the Standard, from 25,000 to 30,000; the Star, from 20,000 to 30,000.;;; The Weekly Observer issues about 5,000 or 6,000 copies; Weekly Dispatch, about 40,000; Bell's Life in London, about 28,000.;;; These Journals are sold at five cents. The Saturday Review, price sixpence, has a circulation of from 5,000 to 6,000; the Athenaeum, sold at four pence, nearly 12,000.;;; The London Illustrated News, which sells at five pence, has a circulation of nearly 100,000.;;; Of the weekly papers sold at two-pence, the Weekly Times (an entirely distinct paper from the London Times,) has a circulation of nearly 85,000; the News of the World, of more than 100,000; Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper and Reynolds' Newspaper, of 160,000 to 180,000 copies.;;; Nevertheless, the public journals, it is remarked, form only a small portion of the periodical press, the family journals, published on Saturday, some of which have a circulation of 400,000 copies and the vast number of illustrated stories, novels and miscellanies, published on the same day and sold at low prices, completely throwing into the shade the circulation of the newspapers.;;; In England, it is added, every class and every opinion has its organ.;;; The sporting world are represented by Bell's Life, The Sunday Times, The Era, The Field, The Sporting Times; and agriculture and commerce by the Mark Lone Express, the Farmers' Journal and the Gardeners' Chronicle. The various shades of opinion in the Anglican Church are represented by The Guardian, The English Churchman, the John Bull, The Recorder; the Dissenters have Non-Conformists, The Patriot and The Bulwark; the Methodist, the British Banner and the Wesleyan Times; the Roman Catholic Church, The Tablet and the Weekly Register.--The small towns have generally their weekly gazettes, while such a city as Edinburg has eighteen, and Glasgow thirty, besides their daily papers.;;; Politically, the London Times, ""that Proteus of journalism, represents, properly speaking, only the fluctuations of public opinion, to the pressure of which it invariably yields; it owes its power, perhaps, solely to that unquenchable mobility which is its only role and its pervading spirit."" The Morning Post, The Globe, The Observer, the Edinburgh Review, The Examiner, are mentioned as the principal organs of the Whig party; the Daily News, an independent liberal journal, represents more particularly the Russell coterie of that party.;;; The Tory organs are the Morning Herald, The Standard, The Press, Fraser's Magazine, Blackwood's Magazine, the Quarterly Review, and the Constitutional Press.;;; The Morning Chronicle represents the liberal conservative party; the Morning Star, the so-called liberal school of Manchester; the Daily Telegraph and the Westminster Review, radicalism; the Morning Advertiser is the organ of the ultra Protestant party.;;; "

1860-11-07_article_120	1860-11-07	article	Encouragement to agriculture.	";;; Encouragement to agriculture.;;; We have lately remarked that the rapid exhaustion of the soil in some sections of the United States will soon require the serious and organised action of our agricultural classes, and probably the protection of the government.;;; Indeed, in the absence of any such course, we think it is the duty of the government to foster the agriculture interests, which are the interests of the mass of the American people.;;; The ancient Egyptians, Assyrians, Persians, Phænicians, Jews, Chinese and the inhabitants of ancient India, became great and prosperous by bringing the power of government and religion in aid of individual industry in cultivating the earth.;;; All the modern governments of Europe have adopted and are now practicing upon this ancient principle of national improvement.;;; Is it not astonishing that the National and State governments of this free, agricultural country, are the only ones in the world that give no direct assistance to agriculture?;;; This is the more remarkable when we consider the following words from the last message of President Washington to Congress:;;; ""It will not be doubted with reference either to individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary importance in proportion as nations advance in population and other circumstances of maturity; this truth becomes more apparent and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage.;;; ""Institutions for promoting it grow up, supported by the public purse; and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of boards composed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffusing information enabled by premiums and small pecuniary aids to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and improvement.;;; ""This species of establishment contributes doubly to the increase of improvement, by stimulating enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a common centre the results everywhere of individual skill and observation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation.;;; Experience accordingly has shown that they are very cheap instruments of immense national benefits."";;; Whilst the laws of Congress for 1789 to 1836 are overflowing with provisions for the protection of manufactures; whilst from 1816 to this time, we have expended for repairs, increase and support of the navy, which is established for the protection of commerce, nearly one hundred and fifty millions of dollars, there has never been one dollar appropriated for the direct encouragement of agriculture, which is the business of nine-tenths of the American people.;;; "
1860-11-07_article_121	1860-11-07	article	Put not your trust in Princes.	";;; Put not your trust in Princes.;;; The Paris correspondent of the London Times says that the day after the battle of Castlepidardo, General Cialdini received the Count Bourbon De Chains and some other French officers who had capitulated.;;; In the course of conversation one of the French officers said, ""Well, General, you have beaten us but we shall soon have our turn, for General Goyon and our countrymen under his orders are not far off."" To which the General replied, ""you must think me very simple to have come here without the Emperor's permission.;;; It was I who settled the campaign with him at Chamber, and his last recommendation was that if the matter was to be done let it be done quickly."" In a letter which Victor Emanuel wrote a short time since to the King of Naples at Gaeta, he said, speaking of Garibaldi, ""try to beat him; try to catch him, and, above all, hang him!"" The correspondent is assured that the King of Naples repeated these words to a great personage now or lately at Gaeta.;;; With all this, Victor Emanuel and Garibaldi will probably be the best friends in the world when they meet; but the ""Re Galantuomo"" occasionally passes through phases of temper not quite in keeping with his designation.;;; "
1860-11-07_article_122	1860-11-07	article	Fallen Greatness.	;;; Fallen Greatness.;;; The New York Express says there are actors now in that city after whom the town once ran wild; women who were the toast of the clubs, the admiration of one sex and the envy of the other; men whose talents and whose personal appearance were as conspicuous as those of any of the popular favorites of the day; but some of them are box openers at the theatres, and others play third-rate parts on the boards where they were once stars.;;; In the very plays in which they trod so proudly, the cynosures of every eye, they now assist at the triumphs of a successor.;;; They must contribute what of strength and talent is left them, to enhance the glories of another; they must sacrifice their own little chances of applause to increase the enthusiasm with which the new comer is received.;;; Nothing, says the Express, can be sadder, nothing can possibly be bitterer than this cup of mortification thus pressed to the unwilling lips of a once successful actor.;;;

Field, of Culpeper."" While the character of my father is too well established among those who know him to be affected by such an article, respect for public sentiment requires it to be noticed.;;; Having read in the Enquirer an editorial advocating resistance and disunion upon the election of Mr. Lincoln, and believing the step to be premature and injudicious, Judge Field wished to counteract, as far as in his power, the influence of opinions leading to this result, and was thus induced to write his letter to the Observer. The letter sustained the policy of abiding the election of Mr. Lincoln only ""so long as he supports the Constitution of the United States and executes in good faith the laws of the Union."" Whatever may have been the form and tone of the letter, the purpose was an honest one, and one which better men than the pensioned editor of the Richmond Enquirer will approve aid endorse.;;; It is by no means a contemptible party who are in favor of secession only when our rights have in reality been assailed, and who are opposed to permitting the too hasty action of heated partizans and the selfish plotting of unprincipled men to precipitate the Southern States into Disunion, with its attendant destruction of life and property — with every horror of servile and civil war. The charge that, in writing his letter, Judge Field was actuated by desire of more elevated position under the Lincoln Administration, is a falsehood as slanderous as untrue. Were Judge Field a young man, just entering with the ambition and energy of early manhood the theatre of public life, the charge might be plausible; against a man who has almost reached the allotted age of three score years and ten, it is more absurd than unjust.

An old bear-hunter tells the story of his following him for many months without success, and that he finally concluded he was a creation of the evil one, to bewilder him and damage his soul.;;; A similar brute to the one described in the tale has infested the San Joaquin valley, between the San Joaquin river and the coast range, for at least three years. He was a grizzly of enormous size, but of great speed.;;; Parties of farmers and cattle-raisers turned out again and again to pursue him, but when they thought they surely had him, the beast suddenly disappeared, as if he had suck into the ground.;;; Bullets appeared to have no effect upon him. He has been a terror to everything on four legs in that district, and many a fat bullock has made a meal for him. The farmers became almost as superstitious as the old hunter, and some almost believed, like him, that Old Nick protected their scourge.;;; A few days ago, however, the illusion was dispelled.;;; Dr. Samuel Mitchell and some other gentlemen got upon the track of the long-dreaded depredator about fifty miles from this city, near the San Joaquin, and succeeded in killing him. He was worn down almost to a skeleton, and the captors, we presume, did not have as much difficulty with him as if he was in full health and strength.;;; They found eighteen balls in their prize.;;; The residents of the valley are fortunate in being finally rid of him.-- San Joaquin (Cal.) Republican.;;; "

A little girl, a sister of the damsel, jumped up, and looking archly at her sister, said, in a tone loud enough for every one to hear, ""Yes, sir, our Becky does."";;; "

1860-11-02_article_51	1860-11-02	article	Tragic affair in Boston.a young lady shot by her Lover.	;;; Tragic affair in Boston.a young lady shot by her Lover.;;; A tragic affair occurred in Boston on Tuesday, the chief actor being Jos. G. Hernandez, recently of Savannah, Ga., but for some time a storekeeper in Boston, and the victim was Miss Fanny May, a young lady of seventeen, whom he had met by appointment at a shoe store in Hanover street. The Herald says:;;; Miss May was the first to arrive at the store, and she was sitting at a desk in the rear part of the store, looking over some papers and doing some figuring.;;; Hernandez entered the store and was observed by one of the parties in the store to be talking with Miss May, and the next thing that was noticed was the report of a pistol, and Miss May was heard to scream and then to stagger back and fall to the floor.;;; After regarding her for a moment, Hernandez started to leave, but after taking a few steps he took a paper from his vest pocket, and swallowing the contents, threw the paper into the stove.;;; He then again cocked his pistol, which he had all along held in his hand, and placing the muzzle to his left side, just under the breast, he fired and fell.;;; At this time the young man in the store had in a measure recovered from the fright and agitation into which the shocking tragedy had thrown him, and he called lustily for assistance, which was soon at hand.;;; The scene in the store at the time was most tragic.;;; The attendant was imploring assistance with horrified eagerness, while on the floor, weltering in their blood, lay the bodies of the apparently murdered woman and her murderer.;;; Miss May was lifted into a chair, and it soon appeared that her hurts were not so serious as were feared.;;; The ball had struck on her forehead, and, glancing off, had made but a flesh wound, from which she will recover.;;; She was taken to the home of her relatives in a carriage.;;; Mr. Hernandez, when raised, was bleeding very freely, and was taken to his residence at No. 32 Leverett street, where the doctors expect he will soon breathe his last.;;; The wound made by the pistol ball is in the lower part of the abdomen, on the left side, and it is not believed that this alone will prove fatal.;;; The physicians fear, however, that the poison may have a fatal effect.;;; It has been ascertained that he took a dose of poison, and that the drug was arsenic.--After taking a small quantity, he threw the remainder, with the paper, into the stove.;;; A portion of this has been saved.;;; Mr. Hernandez states himself that he took the arsenic, and that he purchased it in Fall River.;;; It appears that four shots were fired, the first of which was directed to Miss May. He fired two across the room in rather a promiscuous manner, and the fourth he discharged with suicidal intentions.;;; Miss May is a second cousin of the wife of Mr. Hernandez, and for some years past has been befriended by her, and it was by her instigation that Fanny was employed by her husband to aid and assist him in his business.;;; For the term of two years past, Mrs. Hernandez states that she has been well aware of an improper intimacy existing between Miss May and her husband, and though as a wife she has felt justly indignant and hurt at this state of facts, still she contented herself with earnestly remonstrating with her husband, and discharging Fanny from his employ, which discharge she paid no heed to, nor did Mr. Hernandez insist on the discharge.;;; Thus matters have continued along until very recently, when Miss Fanny received the addresses of a young man in Lawrence, and became desirous of breaking her connection with her former employer, after having, as Mrs. Hernandez says, been the means of almost ruining him in a financial point of view.;;; The result of all this has been the terrible attempt at life which we have already detailed.;;; Its cause is most immediately explained in his own language just before the attempted commission of the dreadful tragedy.;;; It is stated in the following:;;;   Dear Wife:;;; --Forgive me for what I do.--Live for your children.;;; I have been as man and wife for two years with Fanny May. She has been the cause of this.;;; If Mr. Hall had not interfered this would not have happened.;;; May God bless you, my poor children.;;; I cannot live long.;;; I have been ruined in business by Fanny May. You will find some friends left when I am gone.;;; You need not be ashamed of what I have done.;;; Those who have ruined me will have to go with me.;;; Friend Slater, see me decently buried.;;; I am not afraid to meet my God.;;; Keep me as long as possible, and bury May and I.;;; Good  bye, Joseph.;;; Boston, Oct. 30th, 1860.;;; He was a middle-aged man, of a dark complexion, and was well known on Hanover st., as a dealer in fancy goods, and an active man. He had just concluded a purchase of a bill of goods, at a fancy goods house a few doors above the scene of the tragedy, and we do not learn that at this time he showed any signs of excitement or insanity, or that he appeared any other way than in his usual manner.;;; 
1860-11-02_article_52	1860-11-02	article	NO HEADER	;;; The Subtlety of Poisons.;;; --At a recent discussion before the Society of Arts, in London, on the detection of arsenical poisoning, Dr. Letheby traced the progress of toxicological research from the trial of Donald, in 1815, up to the present time.;;; A little while before that period, ten grains of arsenic were required to make a metallic test satisfactory in a court of law. Afterwards, Dr. Black improved the process till he could detect the poison if he had one grain to operate upon.;;; It was then thought a marvel of toxicological skill when Dr. Christison said he only required the 16th of a grain; but now we can trace the presence of the 250,000,000th of a grain of arsenic!;;; It is to be feared that the detection of this particular poison has reached an almost dangerous degree of delicacy, and extreme caution is necessary in examination for its criminal administration.;;; We live surrounded by means of unconsciously absorbing traces of arsenic; we breathe arsenical dust from the green wall papers of our rooms; the confectioners supply it wholesale in their cake ornaments and sweetmeats; the very drugs prescribed for our relief are tainted with arsenic; nay, more, even our vegetable food, as Professor Davy has lately pointed out, may be contaminated with arsenic; and there is probably no drinking water containing iron without a trace of arsenic as well.;;; The poison may thus be stored up in the system till, in the course of years, the amount becomes appreciable.;;;

The colonists usually manufacture about 5,000 dozen brooms annually, and the balance of the crop is sold at the East.;;; Of other crops, they have now on the ground about 2,000 acres of wheat; 2,000 of corn; say 2,000 of various other crops, such as sugar cane, potatoes, etc., and 1,000 acres of grass, Hungarian and timothy.;;; The whole estate is in admirable condition, showing unwearied care and excellent judgment on the part of the managers.;;; The stock of the domain is large, and the barns and sheds for cattle and broom corn are of mammoth proportions.;;;

An aid-de-camp was appointed to the spit, but the mischief was done, and when the reverend father had ""blessed the meat, "" he turned to the Dictator, and said, sternly, ""General, the man who deserts his post in war time--"" ""Should be shot,"" interrupted the self-convicted Dictator.-- Letter in Daily Telegraph.;;; "

A few months ago he removed to Clinton, on the line of the Buffalo and Huron railway, where his family are at present.;;; He came here on Saturday week, and at first appeared very unsettled, and told some of his acquaintances that this would be the last time they would meet — they had better shake hands.;;; The week passed on till Saturday morning, when he was noticed going into a field where some boys were burning brush, and sat down on the burning pile till all his clothes were burned off him. The boys gave the alarm, when two persons came and dragged him off, but he still persisted in going on.

1860-11-02_article_117	1860-11-02	article	Uses and abuses of Agricultural Fairs.	";;; Uses and abuses of Agricultural Fairs.;;; In an article on this subject, the New York Journal of Commerce, after referring at length to the vast popularity and permanent advantages of Agricultural Fairs, mentions what it considers their abuses, in the various shows which have been admitted on their grounds.;;; The New Jersey State Fair is described as having been an amusing but odd exhibition of scientific, military, horticultural, animal and fantastic sounds and sights, whilst there was a ""trial of speed,"" in addition to the other attractions.;;; At the Maine State Fair, the trial of speed was a horse race.;;; The Portland Argus gave a full report of the race ""for the Society's sweepstakes"" The public interest, even in the solemn State of Maine, seems to have been centred in that attraction.;;; There are few persons insensible to the beauty of blood horses, and the desirableness of improving and extending the race.;;; The throngs which assemble on that portion of our own Fair Grounds whenever the horses are exhibited, show the interest and popularity of such a show among our own people, and, so far from being an abuse, the horse show is considered here one of the greatest attractions and advantages of an agricultural exhibition.;;; It is true, however, that, with occasional exceptions, we have nothing which could be technically pronounced racing, the layers of that sport being in general magnificently entertained at the Fairfield Course, or at Ashland.;;; The late races upon that course, by the way, were worthy of the palmiest days of the Old Dominion.;;; The Journal pays a just tribute to the value of Fairs in general, ""an institution almost as old as commerce,"" and which, in their application to agriculture, have been of great practical advantage to the farming interests.--The improvements introduced into them during the last half century; the agricultural colleges and institutions of a similar nature founded in this and other lands; the agricultural schools, where the art is taught in all its branches, having large farms attached, depending entirely on the students and professors for cultivation, and from which they repair to the recitation room to render the system of instruction complete by combining theory and practice, have all been followed by the most beneficial results.;;; And yet, as the Journal truly says, our countrymen are so far from perfection that they cannot even pretend to compete with the agriculturists of Europe.;;; But then it ought to be remembered that the despotic governments of the Old World give liberally to the support of agriculture, while this republican country, which has extended efficient protection to manufactures, and appropriated vast sums to the defence of commerce, has never appropriated a dollar to the agricultural interests, which constitute the occupation of nine-tenths of the American people.;;; The exhausting effects of our past mode of cultivation upon the soil, which is becoming worn out in all parts of the country, is a subject which demands the united attention of all the agriculturists of the land, and which might well demand the attention of the government.;;; We hear complaints from all sections of a serious falling off in the productiveness of the earth, which has been drained of its vitality, and no means adapted for its regeneration.;;; This matter will become serious before many years, and ought to be looked to in time.;;; "
1860-11-02_article_118	1860-11-02	article	The London press on the Prince's visit.	";;; The London press on the Prince's visit.;;; Some of the London journals, which had received advices of the Prince of Wales' arrival in the United States, are graciously pleased to signify their approval on the whole of American deportment on this trying occasion.;;; They express themselves in that characteristic style of dignified condescension and patronizing graciousness which arrested the admiration of Mr. Samuel Weller in the fashionable footmen at the ""mutton swarry,"" and which, as that individual observed, is ""werry pooty to look at. "" There is some ill-nature in some of their allusions, which, considering the hospitable reception extended to the Prince would be somewhat offensive, but that we charitably attribute it to their envy at the superior degree of consideration shown by their royal master to the American sovereigns over his own plebeian subject cts. No British commoner ever presumed to shake hands with the Prince of Wales, and even the gallant officers of his squadron at Portland were greeted with a formal bow, whilst here the royal hand was freely extended to all his brother monarchs, in the most fraternal spirit.;;; No British lady can aspire to the honor of a dance with such a , whilst here our American Queens and princesses were recognized as all  to that proud social distinction.--No English journalist can approach the royal presence without fear and trembling, while here more than one of the press entertained and dined with H.R.H. in an agreeable and social manner.;;; We can easily understand, therefore, why some of the English newspapers are not so enraptured with the American reception of the representative of their government as might be expected.;;; We do not hold the Prince nor any of his suite responsible for the discourtesy of these journals, for all the royal party were delighted with the visit, except the footmen and other servants, who, like their brethren of the London press, considered this ""a blasted country."" The London Times is good enough to congratulate us on the opportunity we have enjoyed of seeing the ""first gentleman of England,"" and certainly he is the first gentleman of that kingdom who ever made a flying trip through the United States.;;; With the exception of H. R. H., the Duke of Newcastle, Earl of St. Germane, General Bruce, and other noble gentlemen of the suite, most of the transient visitors from England to America have been snobs, of the first water, vulgar pretenders, who have given our countrymen a very unfavorable and unjust impression of English character.;;; We are happy that the Prince of Wales and the high-bred gentlemen in his train have enabled us to correct this impression, and we are sure they have left the kindest feelings towards themselves, personally, throughout the United States.--Prince Albert Edward, the London journals may be assured, is a universal favorite here, and it is a pity that many of his editorial subjects are not worthy, in character and manners, of such a Prince.;;; "

";;; The city of New York.;;; This great American city is paying the unvarying penalty of success in the envy, spite and misrepresentation which are constantly rained upon her head, but which she dashes off with no more effort than the lion shakes the dew drops from his mane, or the Great Eastern scatters the opposing waters from her bow in empty froth and foam.;;; Whatever may be the peculiar defects of New York character, in a political point of view, that city is the most American city in the United States.;;; There is neither sectionalism of feeling, nor provincialism of utterance among the native population of New York.;;; We have heard it often remarked that it is impossible in conversation with an educated New Yorker to decide what part of the country he is from.;;; If it is possible to decide that fact by his sentiments of nationality, it is because New York is the most national of cities, not even excepting the seat of federal government.;;; Of course, these remarks do not apply to the immigrants from New England States to New York, who require a long residence there before they become nationalized either in sentiment or speech.;;; The weak points of New York are unfortunately prominent and conspicuous, and offer a ready handle to those whose inferior enterprise and want of success afford them no more substantial means of retaliation.;;; Her ""upper ten thousand"" are as ridiculous as her lower ten thousand are coarse and brutal, and she has more than her fair proportion of crime and ruffianism, simply because she is the great commercial city of this continent, the reservoir in which not only all the enterprise but all the villainy of the old world is first poured in America, before it is distributed to other parts of the country.;;; The politicians have availed themselves of that barbarous element which is to be found in all large cities, and thoroughly organized it into depraved and criminal train bands, nominating, in primary caucuses packed to suit their purposes, their own creatures for offices, whilst virtuous and respectable citizens abandon the polls in disgust.;;; The consequence is that, officially as well as socially, New York is made to present an aspect to outsiders which is at once ridiculous and repulsive, but as false to her real character as it is possible to conceive.;;; Between the upper and lower strata of New York society, may be found half a million of as industrious, intelligent and orderly a population as the sun shines on. The Duke of Newcastle, who, as well as all the royal party, must have been thoroughly nauseated with the intense vulgarity of the foolish aristocracy at the ball, were enthusiastic in their admiration of the New York People, who lined the vast thoroughfares of that city on the arrival of the Prince, the Duke declaring that he had never seen a grander spectacle.--We can well believe it. Soldiers and shows they had seen many times in far greater numbers than America could exhibit, but we doubt whether that or any other royal party ever before passed in review three miles of as wide awake, well dressed, and manly a population.;;; If the Union of these States shall ever be dissolved, there is at least one city in it whose skirts will be clear, and that is — New York.--From the first moment to the last of the Government, she can show a clean hand on that subject.;;; There never has been an hour when the taint of abolitionism or of treason has touched her heart.;;; At this moment, amid the boiling sea of sectional passions, she is the only firm and stable object in the flood, and stands the Pharos of the storm-tost shore, the constellated lights of the Union still shining brightly amid the surrounding darkness, and giving the only rays of cheer and guidance that now break upon the troubled sea. We predict that this patriotic and chivalrous metropolis will maintain its character to the last, and if she loses all else in this contest, will not lose her Honor.;;; "

Engs, from the Executive Committee, stated that they had, with the assistance of Mr. Brady, in a very short time prepared an address, which might not be faultless, and which might meet with criticism, and he hoped it would.;;; He then read the address, from which we make the following extracts:;;; In the language of Breckinridge, ""there can be no evasive middle ground in regard to this question of negroes,"" and we National Democrats of the city of New York say to the men of the South and of the North, no State shall be coerced into remaining in this Union when, in the judgment of her people, her safety requires that she should secede in order to protect the lives and property of her citizens.--[Applause.] And on the other hand we proclaim our willingness and ability to meet the ""irrepressible conflict"" upon our own soil, [applause,] and assure our Southern brethren that if they will remain for a time within the Union, we will put down this fanatical raid upon the Constitution, the South, the Union of these States, and the whole white race.;;; It must be conceded that in the recent canvass many of the Republican presses have claimed for Mr. Lincoln that he did not concur with the frenzied felons who in their fierce onslaught upon slavery, blasphemously assail all ordinances of God and man which interfere with their dogmas or designs.;;; His declarations are cited to the effect that he recognizes the constitutional sanction of Slavery in the States, the validity of the Fugitive Slave law, and is opposed to negro suffrage.;;; His sincerity, and that of the more conservative of his party, is now to be tested.--There is some consolation in the canvass of our State, deplorable as its principal effect has proved.;;; The Republican party of the State, while it was enabled to give Lincoln some fifty thousand majority, did not sustain the proposition to amend our Constitution by permitting negroes to vote without a property qualification.;;; That measure is defeated by an overwhelming majority.;;; In our city it received about sixteen hundred votes, while the vote against it numbers about thirty-seven thousand.;;; It is our opinion that there are, in the Republicans ranks of the North, fewer Abolitionists than our friends of the South suppose, and an effort is to be made to prevent Mr. Lincoln's Administration from interfering with or impairing the equality of the South in the Union.;;; Assurances of this kind are very general in this region.;;; In view of these facts, and considering now momentous must be the consequences of breaking up that Union f sovereign States which the blood and wisdom of our ancestors organized, we earnestly entreat our brethren at the South not to resolve upon any act which may dissever our Confederacy at this time.;;; Let us wait, at least until the 4th of March next, and then learn upon what principles Mr. Lincoln proposes that our Federal Government should be administered.;;; Let us see what class of men will be called to his Cabinet.;;; If, in the selection of doctrines or Ministers he evinces a tendency which may be regarded as calculated to impair the rights of any portion of our Confederacy, it will then be time enough to take deficit action.;;; If secession should now take place, and the Southern Senators resign, the whole power of the Government would be placed in Mr. Lincoln's hands, and all Southern co-operation taken from the patriotic men of other sections who are prepared to support Southern rights to the last extremity.;;; This withdrawal would be particularly deplorable in view of the fact that Mr. Lincoln is to have a majority against him in the House as well as the Senate, if our friends remain where they are.;;; Brethren of the South, we call upon you not to desert us who have to the best of our capacity, and without hope or chance of preferment, profit or reward, other than the consciousness of having acted well, maintained the political doctrines which you advocate.--Do not leave is in a hopeless and enduring minority.;;; Do not infer from the vote in this State that the South as so few friends here as the canvass might seem to indicate.;;; Mr. Douglas drew off from their natural allegiance masses of men, who from personal preference, or the habits of organization, adhered to him, and we had no aid from any of the ordinary organizations by which the Democratic ticket is generally supported.;;; We had to rely upon the staunch and fearless support of men whom no mere party call could control, no persuasion allure, and no fear drive away from their sense of duty to the whole country, [applause,] the men who stand up and battle for the Constitution and the Union, and equality in the Union to all the States.* * * *;;; Candidates whom the South can support, and acceptable also to the National Democracy of the North, have as a capital whereon to urge forward in pursuit of honorable victory the votes cast for Breckinridge and Lane, and perhaps as the contest has become in all respects a national one, those also which Bell and Everett obtained.;;; Thus will be formed the great national party of our country, and around its banner all the true Democrats will rally, leaving the obsolete leaders of decayed factions in the ignominious obscurity and pitiful impotency which their meanness, folly, or corruption has secured for them.;;; Is the hope of opportunity for thus concentrating our forces to be destroyed by the South?;;; That is the question to be dealt with by our friends there, and to be dealt with now. Its solution we leave to these friends, confiding in their honor, patriotism and chivalry.;;; We are ready and eager to contend for and maintain all their rights in any contingency.;;; but to give the struggle even one ray of hope must have their earnest and persistent co-operation.;;; Will they remain with us, or leave us?;;; We ""pause for a reply,"" but we do not fear it. We think we can behold in the brighter days of our country soon to come, the splendid spectacle of a united and irresistible party, which, trampling down the bigot and the fanatic, whose false and odious heresies about the negro race have too long disturbed our repose, will place the Constitution, with all its sanctions and guarantees, in such position and keeping as that every American citizen, in all parts of our country, shall, under its wise execution, have protection for all his property and an equal enjoyment with his fellow of all the territory as of all the welfare which our nation may acquire.;;; [Applause.];;; In the name of our past history, in the name of humanity, regulated by liberty, civilization and progress, in the interests of commerce and property, by all the ties of fraternity and good will that ought to exist between the South and the National Democracy of the North, by all that is good in past, present, or future, we ask you to trust the fate of this battle to us. Ours is a common cause.;;; The attack is made here.;;; Trust the defence to us. We will resist the enemy successfully.;;; We have stood by you; stand by us, and, notwithstanding the imminent peril now threatening the common country, we will thus survive the shock, and preserve unimpaired this glorious Union of free and equal sovereign States, composed of free and equal white men. [Loud applause];;; In making this appeal at the present juncture, we are impelled not only by the considerations already presented, but by the evidence daily accumulating, that even uncertainty as to the course the South will pursue is seriously endangering our various interests, and rendering probable a commercial revulsion far more general and disastrous than that of 1857, from the effect of which we have scarcely yet revived.;;; Such a result would be productive not only of permanent injury to our city and all the interests depending upon it, but would entail on thousands of our laboring Democratic brethren during the coming winter, if not for a much longer period, want and suffering to a fearful extent.;;; "

The sun set at 10.30 P. M., and rose at 2.40 A. M., twilight continuing so that the voyagers wrote out their journals at midnight without the aid of lamps.;;; A sensation day.;;; Wednesday, August 1, was a fine day, with no lack of sensation for the ship's company.--At 10 in the morning the shore of Disco Island was about five miles off, and visible for the length of thirty miles north and south.;;; The high mountain peaks, their tops hidden in the clouds, and seemingly reaching to the sky above; the mountain sides covered with snow and the dazzling glaciers, constituted a glorious scene; and still more so was it in the gorgeous lights and shades of sunset.;;; At noon forty-seven icebergs were counted on the port side of the vessel.;;; One monster resembled a Mississippi steamboat loaded with cotton, only much magnified; another looked like a house, the gable and toward the spectator; another bore a very striking resemblance to the Coliseum at Rome; another was like a quadrangular fort with its cannon mounted and its sentries on duty; another sailed majestically on like a square-rigged ship; and others, in which the imagination discovered animals, buildings, castles, cattle-deals and a thousand vagaries of form.;;; When off Omenak Fiord, at 7 P. M., eighty-nine icebergs were counted across the mouth of that sound, and there were over 140 in sight to the westward.;;; These came from a mer de glace in the interior, though some of the young gentlemen averred that there was a steam factory constantly engaged in their manufacture, which statement was favored by the fact that on the borders of the ""fiord"" was a large coal mine.;;; On Saturday, August 4, the sun did not set upon the expedition.;;; This was the first night in which they had entire sunlight.;;; The sky being cloudless, the sun was seen the entire night, first to pass slowly in a circle to the northward, and then eastward, till it began to rise again.;;; The expedition was becalmed several days off ""Svorte Hook,"" but at length reached a point within sight of the low islands beneath Sanderson's Hope, a great landmark for Arctic navigators.;;; At this time a scene of sublimity was witnessed.;;; The coast, for miles on either hand to the north and south, was plainly visible.;;; Cliffs, high or low land, mountains and inlets, were seen in the distance, while around the vessel floated thousands of icebergs.;;; In the intervals between the heavy reports and roar of falling or turning icebergs, the noise of the surf or sea beating against each of the many bergs was distinctly heard, sounding as a distant Niagara, or a near small water fall, so continuous was the noise.;;; The greater part of the time the crushing and crumbling of the bergs in turning over and coming in collision with each other, or of detached pieces falling, or a glacier parting from its mer de glace and rolling down a thousand feet into the sea, kept up a terrific cannonade.;;; arrival at Proven.;;; At 11 o'clock Sunday night, August 5, when the vessel lay becalmed about 15 miles from Proven, Mr. Sontag, the only man on board, besides the cook, who could speak the Danish language, left the vessel and was rowed to the shore, where he arrived about 3 o'clock in the morning.;;; He awoke the Danish officials, through whose assistance he procured boats, manned by Esquimaux, and after an absence of twenty-three hours, returned to the schooner.;;; The arrival of the Esquimaux, male and female, they being the first natives seen by the ship's company, created quite a sensation.;;; The Esquimaux Pilot.;;; The pilot, the only one of them who could speak any English, was a half breed Dane.--He spoke but a few words, which he stammered out, accompanied by a spasmodic action of his right leg and arm, similar to a dancing Jack.;;; He wore reindeer skin boots, seal skin half breeches, a colored cloth overshirt with a hood at the back, and a fur cap without any visor.;;; He was greasy and dirty both in clothes and person, but he had an intelligent countenance.;;; After the boatmen had taken some refreshment, they towed the ""United States"" into Proven harbor, where she remained seven days.;;; The expedition made the island of Disco in twenty-one days from Boston, which is probably the shortest passage ever made.;;; They were greeted at Proven by a salute fired by order of the Deputy Governor, which was answered by Commander Hayes.;;; The rocks were covered with Esquimaux in their best attire, and picturesque indeed they looked in their many-colored costumes.;;; The vessel was soon surrounded by ""hyaks"" -- the singular canoe of the Esquimaux.;;; To one of the natives was given a piece of salt pork if he would turn over in his hyak in the water.;;; He did so very quickly.;;; The stay at Proven.;;; The stay of the expedition at Proven was quite pleasant.;;; The cargo was all broke out and removed in boats to the shore, whence it was re-stowed on board.;;; The ship's company were assisted by forty or fifty Esquimaux.--They worked hard all day, and gave their nights to jollity, attending balls, parties and feasts, given in their honor by the natives.--The Danish official rendered Dr. Hayes and his officers every service in their power, and the usual courtesies passed between them.--Numerous presents were made to the Danes of delicacies for the table, in return for which they sent fur garments, which were of better quality and make than any that could be bought.;;; Death of the Carpenter and Accidents.;;; On the following day, while the expedition was on the way to Uppernavik, Gibson C.

The schooner was out of water twenty-one inches more than when she left Boston harbor, having been lightened, adding greatly to her sailing qualities.;;; Dr. Hayes procured forty dogs, secured the services of six Esquimaux, and hired Mr. Jansen, the assistant of the Danish Governor in charge of the station of Tessuissak, and the only white man in the place.;;; Plans for the future, Btc.;;; Commander Hayes intended to leave Tessuissak about the 28th of August, bound up Smith Sound, on the west side, in order to attain as high a latitude as is possible before winter sets in. Dr. Kane went up on the east side, but Dr. Hayes expects to find the western shore more free from ice. Having attained perhaps 80 degrees, he would, during the mouth of October, carry two boats and a quantity of provisions to some point about two hundred miles north-northwest, which he hopes to accomplish before the long winter's night sets in. In April, or as soon as it is light enough, he will start for the depot, and thence over the ice toward the Pole, carrying the boats to, and launching them upon the open sea, should he find it; if not, he would go over the ice as rapidly and as far as possible.;;; All the ship's company, officers and men, were in excellent health and spirits, and enthusiastic about the result of the expedition.;;; Dr. Hayes enjoys the confidence and affection of all on board, and has displayed those qualities of intrepidity and coolness in times of danger which are so requisite for success.;;; An incident occurred the night before leaving Proven, which illustrates the strong bond of sympathy between Dr. H. and his associates.;;; "

Totty, and, as usual on such occasions, a vast crowd of persons, many of them colored, assembled about the city jail to get a glimpse of the prisoner, as he passed from his cell to the place of execution.;;; Totty was apparently about twenty-five years of age, quite handsome in appearance, and very amiable in disposition, never having been known to engage in an altercation of any kind until about the time of the murder.;;; About four years ago, he married one of the daughters of Wm. Thom, an old citizen, and soon after became connected with the Night Watch of Richmond, which position he filled with entire satisfaction until October, 1859, when he became addicted to intemperance, and resigned his place.;;; From that period until about the 1st of July last, Totty kept a small grocery at the corner of Grace and Monroe streets, in Henrico county, where his wife, her father and her sister resided, and where he committed the deed which cost him his life.;;; The murder.;;; On the morning of the 18th of July, Totty visited the residence of his father-in-law, and repairing to the kitchen, found Catherine J.

On her again declining, he told her to take one of the pistols and shoot him, and that he would shoot her with the other.;;; Supposing him to be joking, Miss Thom told him not to act so foolish, and on seeing him pick up the weapons and aim one at her, she attempted to seize it. Just at that instant the pistol exploded, the bail entering her stomach about three inches above the navel, and passing entirely through her body, lodged in the muscles of her back near the spinal column, producing death that night.;;; Escape of Totty.;;; Immediately after the shooting, Totty fled the scene of blood, and retiring to an old field a short distance west of the city, remained there several hours.;;; During that evening and night, and the entire of next day, the police of the city were in search of him, and telegraphic messages were dispatched along the wires, to ensure his capture.;;; The Executive, too, offered a reward for his apprehension, and anxiety was felt that he would escape.;;; Arrest of Totty.;;; On the morning of the 20th, officer Morris was informed that Totty was at the Mount Vernon Hotel, and finding him there in conversation with a brother, took him into custody, and deprived him of the weapons in his possession.;;; Totty requested that he might be taken to the grave of his victim, and the request being granted, he shed tears over the last resting place of the unfortunate woman.--When taken to his cell, he begged the officers to kill him, declaring that he could never survive a trial.;;; That day he was examined before the Mayor, and remanded for further examination.;;; trial.;;;  At the August term of Judge Lyons'Court, the prisoner was put upon his trial, and after hearing the witnesses and argument of counsel, he was found guilty of murder in the first degree.;;; During the trial the unfortunates man preserved entire calmness, and when the verdict was rendered seemed to be in no wise affected.;;; New trial Refused.;;; On the 8th of September, a new trial was asked for and argued before Judge Lyons, and refused.;;; He was then sentenced to be hung on the 3d of November.

From about this time, Totty became earnestly engaged on the subject of religion, and devoted the greater portion of his time to singing and praying, and reading the Bible.;;; As the appointed day approached, he professed a resignation to his fate, and declared himself ready to meet the great Judge above.;;; On the 8th of November, the Governor again respited the condemned man until the 16th inst., giving assurance that he could continue his clemency no longer.;;; From the 8th inst., to the very hour of execution yesterday, Gov. Letcher was petitioned and implored to pardon the doomed man, and to commute his punishment to imprisonment for life; but seeing no good reason for interfering with the judgment of the jury, and believing that it was important to be just, as well as merciful, he refused to stay any longer the execution of the judgment of the Court.;;; The prisoner.;;; At an early hour yesterday morning the doomed man was visited in his cell by his step-mother, brothers and friends, with all of whom he conversed freely and kindly.;;; He expressed himself entirely resigned to his fate, believed that the hand of God was in it, and thought that he had thus been situated that he might be brought to a knowledge of the truth as it was in Jesus.;;; To his minister he confessed the crime and the justness of his sentence.;;; He said he remembered committing the deed, but everything connected with it appeared as a dream to him.

When the procession reached the place of execution, hundreds of persons of all colors had assembled around the spot, while the hill sides to the west and north were literally covered with spectators, anxious to witness the launching of a human soul from time into eternity.;;; When the wagon halted within thirty feet of the ""fatal drop,"" and Sergeant Bray announced his readiness to proceed with his duty, the prisoner, looking pleasantly around him, jumped out of the vehicle, and, a passway having been cleared by the soldiers, walked hurriedly to the gallows, ran lightly up the steps, and taking a stand upon the platform, quietly surveyed the crowd, the familiar old hills, and the inviting scenes which to him were soon to be forever shut from view.;;; Once or twice we thought we saw a shade of sadness pass over his face, as he looked upon the cross-beam, the rope, and the trap, that were to end his existence, but they were soon dispelled, and the same confident smile was restored.;;; The detail of the Public Guard then formed around the gallows, to keep back the crowd.;;; The Death Warrant;;; Sergeant Dudley, as soon as circumstances would allow, ascended the platform to where the prisoner was standing, and after reading to him the sentence of the Court for his execution, told him the duty he had to perform was a very painful one, and shaking him by the hand, said to him, ""May the Lord have mercy on your soul,"" Totty at once grasped the hand of the Sergeant, and giving it a cordial shake, thanked him for his kindness, and begged him to meet him in Heaven.;;; Religious Service.;;; Rev. Mr. Boggs, as soon as the Sergeant left the platform, opened his Bible, and in a loud voice read the 23d Psalm, and a few passages from the 14th chapter of John, to the sentiments in which Totty responded, as the minister read, declaring that his hope was in Jesus.;;; Mr. Boggs then read, at the request of the prisoner, his favorite hymn, commencing,   ""Jesus to thee I now can fly, On whom my help is laid,""etc.,;;; which seemed to assure him of a happy future.;;; Rev. Mr. Boggs next offered up a fervent and eloquent prayer, the prisoner kneeling by him and composedly joining him in his devotions.;;; At the conclusion, he arose, and looking around him, requested Mr. Boggs to say a few words for him.;;; Mr. Boggs stated, that at the earnest solicitation of the prisoner, he would make a statement.;;; Mr. Totty felt that his time on earth was short.;;; He confessed the crime with which he was charged, and acknowledged the justice of his sentence.;;; To intemperance was to be attributed his present situation.;;; Intemperance had brought him to the gallows, and he warned those around him to shun that vice — to seek the Lord while he may be found, and to strive to meet him in Heaven.;;; For his immediate relatives he felt great concern, and had prayed devoutly that they might turn from the error of their ways.;;; To all he bade and affectionate farewell, and prayed that Heaven would bless each one.;;; Mr. Boggs then shock hands with the prisoner, and urging him to put his trust in Christ, bid him good-bye.;;; Totty grasped the minister's hand warmly, and saying in a loud voice, ""God bless you, Mr. Boggs, for your kindness to me--God bless you. Meet me in Heaven"" --turned with a pleasant smile upon his face to receive the rope.;;; The execution.;;; At 25 minutes to 1 o'clock, Jailor Hall proceeded to pinion the prisoner's hands behind him, and to tie his feet together, he being on the drop.;;; The rope was then adjusted to the cross beam, and while it was being fixed around the neck of the condemned man, Mr. Boggs read aloud to him from the Bible, and he responded, saying his trust was in the Lord — he believed in Jesus.;;; He then said to the crowd, ""Let us all meet in Heaven."" He requested Mr. Hall to fix the rope tight, that he might die easy.;;; All being ready, the black cap was pulled over the face of the prisoner.;;; After he had bid adieu to those around him, and while waiting for the fall, his last words were, ""God bless you all — meet me in Heaven."";;; At precisely 20 minutes to 1 o'clock, the drop fell, and William D. Totty was launched into eternity.;;; The ""fall"" of three and a half feet instantly dislocated his neck, and with the exception of three or four slight muscular convulsions, he died without a struggle.;;; After hanging 20 minutes, the corpse was cut down and given to the friends of the deceased, who will have it decently buried to-day.;;; Conclusion;;; We never saw a more orderly, well behaved crowd than that which witnessed the execution yesterday.;;; No noise was to be heard, and he confusion witnessed.;;; Our only regret was, that some few females were in the midst, and that children of tender years were permitted to see a sight so shocking, and, we fear, demoralizing.;;; "

There are now five railways in successful operation in Brazil, four of them finished, and still a sixth in progress of construction.;;; The most considerable of these lines is the Pedro II., which stretches from Rio far into the fastnesses of interior Brazil.;;; This is intended to form a grand trunk for 300 miles inland, opening up the coffee districts of these remote regions and bringing them within hours of the capital.;;; In respect to trade with Brazil, England had long enjoyed a monopoly, or so great a preference as to render it a monopoly to all intents.;;; The Boston Courier makes the United States the purchaser of quite a moiety of her great staple — coffee — and of two-thirds of all the other exports of the empire; while the fact that our exports thither seldom rise to 30 per cent, of our imports thence is placed in somewhat striking contrast.;;; In this way we are purchasing of Brazil, annually, coffee to the amount of $20,000,000, in exchange for $6,000,000 worth of our own products and $14,000,000 in gold.;;; This balance of trade is fear-fully against us, and not very flattering to our self-love; the more so, as England annually exports to Brazil about $24,000,000, and imports only $15,000,000.;;; There is no discrimination by the Brazilian revenue laws in favor of England and against this country; and, therefore, this disparity in the balance of trade between the two nations and Brazil, cannot be attributed to the policy of the latter government.;;; The commerce of Brazil is given up to England and the United States.;;; The two governments are rivals, and British has for once triumphed over American enterprise.;;;

For ourselves, we confess the old, dingy, Indian Summer, with its dark atmosphere, and its sunbeams forcing its way through the cloud, until they fell on earth like the rays of the sun after passing through a window of stained glass, pleased us much better.;;; There was always to us a charm in the soft, dreamy, Indian Summer of the olden time, that we could never explain, nor can we even now understand it. It had a tendency to promote melancholy, but melancholy of a nature so gentle that it was exquisitely luxurious.;;; It seemed to call up the memory of something in the long, long past, which we could not distinctly understand, yet which we eagerly desired to grasp, as though it were the connecting link between our present being and some previous existence, of which all traces had not been entirely extinguished.;;; But now, since nature has raised the misty veil from the face of the Queen of the Seasons, we live, while she lives, in an ocean of unclouded light.;;; We have not lately been in the country; but we suppose the leaves are yet on the trees, presenting that rich variety of colors, the union of which in vests our forests during the present season with a gorgeous magnificence of beauty altogether inconceivable to those who have never seen it. Russet, carnation, yellow, orange, gold — all these tints blend into one picture of indescribable beauty, as cunningly as though arranged by the hand of some skillful painter, expressly with a view to avoid all violent contrasts.;;; And, in truth, there is no painter like nature.;;; It is now the season for field sports, and we presume sportsmen are taking the field in all directions.;;; Some four years ago, an apprehension existed that the breed of partridges had been entirely exterminated by the hard winters.;;; Appeals were frequently made to sportsmen, through the public prints, to abstain from pursuing their game until the remnants, if there were any, should have time to rally and recruit.;;; Either those appeals proved very successful, or the birds have defied the skill of the sportsmen, or the winters have been very propitious, or all this taken together has come to pass; for we learn that there never were so many birds as there are now. We hope the sportsmen will be moderate — shoot not for glory, but recreation-- kill no more than they can eat each day — and carefully abstain from shooting birds on the ground.;;; This last is an offence which ought to be made public.;;; A sportsman who would do it ought to have his gun taken from him, as a knight in the olden time had his spurs hacked off and his sword taken from him, for any offence against the laws of chivalry.;;; It ought to be a point of honor with sportsmen to give the bird a chance for his life.;;; They ought to call a convention of all the sportsmen in the State of Virginia, to establish rules for their sport.;;; We are fast coming to that period of life when it is more agreeable to talk about sporting than to practice it. We recall with infinite pleasure recollections of old sportsmen and their deeds.;;; The present generation may beat them for aught we know — they have better guns and better equipments — yet the obstinacy of age is very strong upon us, and we find it as hard to believe that any of the present generation could beat Charles Taylor, Littlebury Mosby, John Syme, John Heth, Beverly Heth, Meriwether Vaughan and Milks Selden, when they were in their prime, (and, alas!;;; but one of them, Mr. Selden, is now alive,) as we do to believe that any of the horses whose fame now fills the racing journals, are superior to Eclipse and Henry, or Flirtilla and Ariel.;;; We mention the gentlemen above-named, because they were all genuine sportsmen — men who did honor to the craft — men who would as soon think of stealing a sheep or robbing a hen-roost, as of shooting into a covey on the ground.;;; They were models of sportsmen, every one.;;; We hope their successors may be even as they were.;;; "

";;; Transmigration of Souls;;; --How Old Reed was Converted.--The New York correspondent of a Western paper tells the following story for the benefit of some hard cases:;;; He says he once knew a man by the name of Reed, commonly known as Old Reed.;;; Reed was quite notorious in his way, and his religious belief was that after death he should reappear in the form of an animal, and thought he would be a horse. Now, Old Reed was a hard man, and was not in the habit of treating his family as a religious man should.;;; One day after his wife had suffered his abuse as long as humanity could endure, she concluded to give him a brief talking to-- to touch him upon his religious belief.;;; So, resolutely seating herself by his side, and looking him full in the face, while a tear-drop glistened in her eye — for she was serious and thought perhaps he was correct in his faith — she commenced: ""Reed, I wish to have a serious talk with you, I have something to say to you, and you must hear it. I have a duty to perform, and I shall do it, and then, if you are miserable hereafter, it will not be my fault.;;; You believe, Reed.;;; that when you die you will turn into some animal, and you think you will be a horse. --Now, if you keep on your present course, and continue to neglect and abuse your family, squandering your money for drink, and at the gaming table, when you die you will turn into some old twelve shilling horse, and some dirty clam pedlar will get you, and you will be hard worked and half-starved, and I shall see you every day before a rickety old wagon filled with clams.;;; Such will be your eternity!;;; But now, Reed, it needn't be so; your future may be a bright, a happy one.;;; If you will reform and turn right about and become a better man — be kind and affectionate to your family, and treat them as a Christian should, why, when you die, you will turn into a five hundred dollar horse, and some West End buck will get hold of you, and give you a bushel of oats a day, rub you down with pea straw, and have you docked and your tail set up!;;; "" He says Old Reed was straightway converted — was reformed — and is patiently waiting for death to introduce him to his coveted horse heaven--where are only "" shell roads"" and ""two-forty"" nags with ""pricked"" tails.;;; Professional Cards.;;; "

It is absurd to suppose that a President and a Congress and a Judiciary, sworn to maintain the Constitution and the laws, will ever permit a State to secede.;;; If they should, they would violate their oaths and become participants in the crime of treason.--The only other possible method of secession is by violence, involving the nullification of the Federal laws and armed resistance to the Federal authority.;;; In such a contest the slave States would be speedily and deservedly crushed by the strong arm of power.;;; They have neither the wealth, the intelligence, the arts, the arms, nor the character requisite to maintain the struggle."";;; A meeting was held at Woodstock, Shenandoah county, on Monday last, at which, after speeches by Gen.

It will contain, when full, about thirty millions gallons of water.;;; The filter beds, two in number, will be located on the northern side of the new reservoir.;;; They will each be 246 feet long by 150 feet wide.;;; The filtering medium will be sand and gravel, and of sufficient capacity to filter about four and a half millions gallons of water every 24 hours.;;; ""The capacity of the new reservoir will be about thirty millions gallons.;;; The present reservoir is estimated to hold about ten millions gallons more — making the storage capacity of both reservoirs about forty millions gallons — which is equal to about twenty days supply, at the present rate of consumption in the city.;;; Both the new and old reservoirs will be arranged by means of stop cocks and pipes that the water can be drawn at pressure from any one of the several compartments, for the purpose of cleansing or making any repairs to them.;;; ""The very turbid character of the James river during freshets might lead to some apprehensions with regard to clogging up, to which the filtering medium might be subject during such periods.--But when we come to consider that the water of James river is never very turbid for more than four or five days at a time, and that there will be no difficulty in stopping the pumps at such times; and also, that the water will be some twenty days in passing through the different compartments of the reservoir, it is evident that by this arrangement the water will have ample time to deposit its sedimentary load before it reaches the filter beds.;;; ""If, however, at any time the filtering medium should become clogged, the filtering process will be so arranged that the action of the water in passing through the filter beds can be reversed and the sedimentary deposit washed off and out of the reservoir, by means of waste pipes, which are common to the whole system.;;; This plan has been successfully tried by several water companies both in England and Scotland.;;; ""In carrying out this plan more land will be required on the east side of the reservoir than is afforded by the recent purchase from Mr. Wooldridge.;;; It will, therefore, become expedient to purchase the balance of the ground between the reservoir and Hollywood Cemetery.;;; If the reservoir is confined to the present narrow limits, it will become necessary to resort to heavy walls of masonry, with the view to economise space, which will increase the cost of the proposed reservoir fully as much as the price asked for the land.;;; This land will ultimately be required for reservoir purposes, and it will be economy for the city to purchase it now, with the view of the future extension of the works, and also for the purpose of keeping off from the reservoirs all objectionable encroachments.;;; The importance of constructing a new reservoir is evident, when we take into consideration the very limited capacity of the present one and that it is so badly arranged that it is impossible to clean out the deposit of mud which has been accumulating in it for years, without depriving the city of water.;;; ""The following is the estimated cost of improvement: Embankment, $35,000; masonry of affluent and influent chambers, $10,000; cost of filtering arrangements, $25,000; cost of stopcocks, gates and pipes $23,000; cost of land required.;;; $5,000.

Covington replied that he had very little of any kind with him.

";;; The Committee of reception in reply to the Slanders of the New York Times.;;; We subjoin the declaration of the committee of reception upon the Prince of Wales, visit to this city, regretting only that it was not made long ago. It is but too true that truth is lame, while falsehood travels with the rapidity of lightning.;;; A falsehood uttered by a worthless rascal, who was apparently sent here for no other purpose than to libel us, has been circulated in England; has been eagerly seized upon by the London Times as an excuse for denouncing us as the very offscouring of the human race; has, in a word, accomplished its errand of mischief — and now, undo who can what it has done.;;; The committee, in our opinion, acted most unwisely in deferring this declaration so long.;;; No man in these days of newspapers and rapid circulation of intelligence, can afford to shut himself up in his own dignity, and leave it to time to do justice to his character when it is assailed.;;; No man can neglect the smallest lie published to his disadvantage, without manifest danger to his reputation.;;; Truth, they tell us, is mighty, and it will prevail.--And so it is, and so it will, after the victim of a lie shall have been ruined beyond the power of mortal redemption — after his prospects shall have been destroyed, his hopes blasted his health shattered, his heart broken — after his body shall have been laid beneath the clove of the valley.;;; And as it is with the individual man, so it is with a community.;;; It cannot afford to overlook any lie, no matter how insignificant in itself, or how worthless the source from whence it proceeds.;;; It should be taken always at the first hop — denounced at once, flung back in the teeth of the slanderer.;;; We much regret that the committee did not make this publication before.;;; It appears, then, that the reporter of the N York Times was in lodgings in a corner of the city, and that he staid there during the whole time of the Prince's visit.;;; We were going to say that he saw nothing of what he describes; but that is a matter of course.;;; He could not have seen it, for it did not happen.;;; We will amend our statement, therefore, and say that had things happened as he pretended, he could not have known it personally, for he could not have seen what was going on. At the same time, he might very easily have ascertained the whole truth, had he been so disposed.;;; But it suited his purpose to manufacture a malicious lie. He was doubtless sent here to write a libel upon us, because we were slaveholders, and it suited the purpose of the New York Times to represent all slaveholders as vulgar brutes, incapable of behaving with even decency, far less propriety.;;; The lies of the London Times' correspondent are all copied from the correspondent of the New York Times. One lied deliberately; the other copied his lies, and the New York Tribunes, supporting one batch of lies by the other, says that the New York Times must tell the truth, because the London Times says the same thing.;;; The correspondent of the London Times was not even in the city.;;; He stopped in Baltimore, and staid there all the time the Prince was here.;;; The gusto with which the London Times returns to this favorite subject is refreshing.;;; ""Delenda est Carthage"" is now the only word the Thunderer has for Richmond.;;; Richmond must be destroyed, not by war, pestilence and famine, not by fire and sword, not after the fashion of Carthage or Jerusalem, but by neglect. No royal cortege is hereafter to enliven its doomed streets — no royal hope of a King-loving people is to breathe its polluted atmosphere — no magnanimous Briton is to sport his burly carcass from this day forth within its accursed precincts.;;; The decree has gone forth.;;; From this day, Richmond must look to her own spit-boxes; John Bull will no longer supply her with inspectors.;;; She must depend upon her own unassisted imagination for fifty ideas in connection with hip-baths and spit-boxes, and all the abominations so congenial to John's taste.;;; John will not condescend, henceforth, to enlighten her even upon the condition of his belly, upon the stuffing he undergoes at dinner, upon the washings of his feet, the condition of his sheets, or any of the little private incidents which figure so largely in all he has heretofore written about here.;;; John will come here no more.;;; The London Times says the Prince ought not to have come here, and surely, no loyal Englishman will go where the heir apparent ought not to go.--Here is what it says:;;; The truth is, Richmond is a place which the Prince should never have been taken to visit.;;; If there be a place justly odious to the feelings of Englishmen and their sovereign.;;; It is that where the human anomaly which is now almost the only produce of Virginia, is ruthlessly sold for consumption in the dreary plantations of the South. From such a spot every humane and intelligent traveller turns aside with invincible repugnance, and we can hardly regret that those who were so ill-advised as to turn aside from their path to come in contact with this abominable traffic should have a specimen of the quality of the population that subsists on the buying and selling of human flesh.;;; Considering that a large proportion of the Queen's revenue is derived from duties upon the products shipped to her by this race so accursed in her sight, this denunciation will do pretty well.;;; We only wish that it did not bear too great a resemblance to the ""Fence,"" reproaching as a rascal the person from whom he receives his stolen goods.;;; If we are rascals for owning and selling negroes, what are the British purchasers of the products which these slaves create?;;; What is the Queen herself, who derives a revenue from them?;;; What is the Parliament, and what is the Ministry?;;; We have wandered too far from our purpose, which was to lay the subjoined paper before the public:;;; Visit of the Prince of Wales to Richmond;;; It is marvelous now fast a lie will travel, and how difficult it is to put a stop to it when once the steam is up. When the account of the reception of the Prince of Wales in Richmond first appeared in the New York Times, it was apparent to the committee of the Council and citizens, that some professional Munchausen of the press had been employed to promulgate a wholesale slander upon the people of Richmond; and that the article had been accordingly manufactured out of the raw material of falsehood to suit the demand.;;; The committee knew positively and personally that not a word was true relating to the insults alleged to have been offered in the Capitol or elsewhere; that no event transpired, and no word was uttered, which could give the least color to the statement in the ""Times."" They were aware of the fact, on undoubted authority, that the correspondent of the ""Times,"" though in the city, was confined to the house, in a remote part of the suburbs, during the whole of the day, and was not an-eye-witness of any of the scenes he pretends to describe.;;; Yet they did not choose to dignity the petty malice which originated a foul slander upon a whole community, by giving it the importance attached to a public denial.;;; Their guests expressed themselves, and snowed themselves, gratified with the reception accorded them, and that was enough.;;; It was altogether immaterial whether the diseased part of Northern sentiment was propitiated or not, and the sound portion could be relied on to recognize the character of the statement by the source it came from, and the features of untruth upon its face.;;; When the Duke of Newcastle publicly denied the truth of every allegation, it was natural to suppose the wrong would have been confessed, and the charge put at rest.;;; Yet, more recently the London Times has taken up the hue and cry, and to this hour the New York Times and its kin are trying to make themselves and their readers believe it by the force of repetition.;;; The slander travels at a pace which makes it hopeless that the truth can ever overtake it. Having reached the people of England, who may be innocently misled into the belief that it has some foundation, if now becomes a duty to the people of Richmond, of the State, and to all who yet retain a regard for our national reputation, that the proper stamp should be placed upon it by those who had charge of the reception of the Prince, and were personally present during the entire visit to the Church, the Capitol, and the Governor's House; and, accordingly, we take public notice of it, and declare it a sheer fabrication, from beginning to end.;;; The Committee of reception.;;; "

The Founder of the Christian Religion declared that His kingdom was not of this world, and no temptations of his wily enemies could ever induce him to secularize his sacred calling by interfering in the most remote manner with the civil or judicial authorities of the land.;;; Loyalty of the people to their governors and magistrates, obedience of servants to their masters, these are Christian duties, constantly enjoined by Him and His apostles, and to these His ministers in this age and country would do well to confine themselves.;;;

They make quite as respectable a show in point of size as the shipping in the harbor of New York forty years ago. As the deepening of the channel in the James proceeds, we shall be able to bring larger and larger vessels to our wharves, and with the full completion of the York River Railroad, a stream will be brought to our very doors, which will afford an ample additional outlet for the trade that will be concentrated here by our numerous railroads.;;; With such facilities for greatness and independence, Virginia should blush at the idea of being tributary to any other State.;;;
